          social, and cultural systems. Though different in origin, they were not isolated — they
          interacted through trade, religion, culture, migration, and warfare.

        <h2>4. SUMMARY</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Political Structure:</strong> Centralized kingdoms (Oyo, Benin, Kanem-Bornu) vs decentralized societies (Igbo).</li><br>
          <li><strong>Culture and Customs:</strong> Differences in festivals, art, marriage customs, social systems (age grades, chiefs, guilds).</li><br>
          <li><strong>Religious Beliefs:</strong> Yoruba, Igbo, Benin = Traditional religion with Supreme God + lesser gods; Hausa and Kanem-Bornu = Islam; Niger Delta = Traditional religion + early Christianity.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Thus, pre-colonial Nigeria was diverse in politics, culture, and religion, which shaped the
          identity of its people before colonialism.
