         <div class="t2"><b>Meaning of Non-Centralized States</b></div>
        <p>
            <b>A non-centralized state</b> is a political system where authority and governance are distributed among various units or communities, rather than being concentrated in a single central authority. 
            In such systems, decision-making is often communal, with power shared among elders, councils, and age-grade associations. 
            This form of governance is also known as decentralized or stateless societies.
        </p><br><br><br>

        <div class="title" style="background-color: sienna;color: white;"><b>Characteristics of Non-Centralized States</b></div>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Decentralized Governance:</strong> Power is not concentrated in a single ruler but is distributed among various units, such as villages or clans.</li><br>
            <li><strong>Council of Elders:</strong> Elders, often the heads of families or clans, play a significant role in decision-making processes.</li><br>
            <li><strong>Age-Grade Systems:</strong> Communities are organized into age groups that take on specific roles and responsibilities, contributing to social order and development.</li><br>
            <li><strong>Consensus Decision-Making:</strong> Decisions are made collectively, with input from various members of the community, ensuring that all voices are heard.</li><br>
            <li><strong>Absence of Centralized Military Power:</strong> These societies typically do not have a standing army or centralized military force.</li><br>
            <li><strong>Religious and Cultural Institutions:</strong> Religious leaders and cultural institutions often play a role in governance and conflict resolution.</li>
        </ol><br><br><br>

        </ol><br>

        <h2> Conclusion</h2> 
        <p>
            Non-centralized states in pre-colonial Nigeria demonstrated a unique form of governance where power was distributed among various units, allowing for community participation and localized decision-making. 
            While this system had its advantages, such as adaptability and community involvement, it also faced challenges like lack of coordination and potential fragmentation. 
            Understanding these systems provides insight into the diverse political structures that existed in Nigeria before colonial influence.
