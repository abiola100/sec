        <div class="title" style="background-color: purple;color: white;"><b>MARKET AND MARKETING ACTIVITIES</b> </div>
        <div class="t2"><b> Meaning of Market</b></div>
        <p>
        A <strong>market</strong> is any place or system where <strong>buyers</strong> and <strong>sellers</strong> come together to buy and sell <strong>goods or services</strong>. It could be a physical location (such as a town market) or an electronic/online system where exchange takes place. When a buyer and a seller meet and a transfer of ownership of goods or services happens in exchange for money, a <strong>market situation</strong> has occurred.
        </p><br><br>

        <div class="title" style="background-color: seagreen;color: white;"><b>Features of a Market</b></div>
        <p>The following features are necessary for a market to exist:</p>
        <ol>
        <li>There must be at least one <strong>buyer</strong>.</li><br>
        <li>There must be at least one <strong>seller</strong>.</li><br>
        <li>There must be <strong>goods or services</strong> which are bought or sold.</li><br>
        <li>There must be a <strong>medium of exchange</strong> (for example, money) to enable payment.</li><br>
        <li>There must be a <strong>place or system</strong> where the buyer and seller meet (this may be physical or digital).</li><br>
        <li>There must be the <strong>determination of price</strong> (the buyer and seller agree on price).</li><br>
        <li>There should be <strong>freedom of entry and exit</strong> — new buyers and sellers should be able to join or leave the market without undue barriers.</li><br>
        </ol><br>

        <div class="title" style="background-color: sienna;color: white;"><b> Types of Market</b></div>
        <p>There are several types of markets, which can be classified in different ways. Some important types include:</p>

        <h4><strong>1 Commodity Market</strong></h4>
        <p>This is the market for buying and selling <strong>raw materials</strong>, <strong>semi-finished items</strong> and <strong>finished goods</strong>. Examples include agricultural produce, timber, fish, furniture, and clothes. It may take the form of open-air markets, shops, or stalls.</p>

        <h4><strong>2 Money Market</strong></h4>
        <p>This is a financial market where <strong>short-term funds</strong> (money) are borrowed and lent, often between banks or financial institutions. It is not usually open to the general consumer directly.</p>

        <h4><strong>3 Capital Market</strong></h4>
        <p>This is a market for <strong>longer-term funds</strong> and for trading financial assets like stocks, shares, and bonds. It supplies capital to firms and governments. At the JSS level, focus is mainly on commodity and simple markets.</p>

        <h4><strong>4 Retail Market / Wholesale Market</strong></h4>
        <p>Markets may also be classified by the kind of trade:</p>

        <div class="title" style="background-color: sienna;color: white;"><b>Buying and Selling</b></div>
        <h4><strong>Meaning (by Cash and by Credit)</strong></h4>
        <p><strong>Cash transaction</strong>: Buyer pays immediately in money when goods or services are supplied; ownership transfers immediately.</p>
        <p><strong>Credit transaction</strong>: Buyer receives goods or services now but pays later (or in instalments); ownership or final settlement may occur later.</p>

        <h4><strong>Transactions</strong></h4>
        <p>A <strong>transaction</strong> is any business activity where goods, services, or securities change hands, often involving payment. Examples include purchase of goods for cash or credit and sale of shares in the capital market.</p>

        <div class="title" style="background-color: darkolivegreen;color: white;"><b>Cost of Sales, Mark-up, Turnover, Profit & Loss</b></div>
        <h4><strong>Cost of Sales</strong></h4>
        <p>The <strong>cost of sales</strong> (or cost of goods sold) is the direct cost involved in making or buying the goods sold during a period. It includes purchase cost, direct labour, materials, etc.</p>
        <p><strong>Formula:</strong> Cost of Sales = Opening Stock + Purchases – Closing Stock</p>

        <h4><strong>Mark-up</strong></h4>
        <p><strong>Mark-up</strong> is the amount added to the cost price of goods to determine the selling price. Expressed as a percentage of cost.</p>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong> If cost is ₦1,000 and the mark-up is 20%, selling price = ₦1,000 + (20% of ₦1,000) = ₦1,200.</p>

        <h4><strong>Turnover</strong></h4>
        <p><strong>Turnover</strong> is the total sales made by a business in a period; essentially, the total revenue from sales before deducting costs and expenses.</p>

        <h4><strong>Profit & Loss</strong></h4>
        <p><strong>Profit</strong>: When total revenue (sales) is greater than total costs and expenses.</p>
        <p><strong>Loss</strong>: When total costs and expenses exceed total revenue.</p>
        <p>A <strong>profit-and-loss account</strong> shows revenue, subtracts cost of sales and expenses, and provides the net profit or loss.</p>
