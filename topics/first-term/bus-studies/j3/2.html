        <br><br>
        <p>
            <b class="list">Store records</b> can be defined as the organised information about the items kept in a store or warehouse.
            <br><br>
            This includes details like what items are received, what is sold, and how much stock is available. It helps keep track of everything in the store.

        </p>
        <br><br>
        <div class="title1"><b>PROCEDURE FOR STORE RECORDS</b></div>
        <br>
        <br>
        <ol>
            <li>
            
                When items arrive, check them against the purchase order. Record the details, including item description, quantity, and condition, in the store records.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
            
            
                Add the received items to the inventory system. Adjust stock levels to reflect the new quantities available in the store.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
            
            
                Place items in designated storage locations. Label shelves or bins for easy identification and record their locations in the store records.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
            
            
                When items are sold, update the store records to reflect the quantity sold. Deduct the sold items from the inventory to keep stock levels accurate.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
            
            
                Regularly perform stock counts to verify the accuracy of store records. Compare physical stock with the recorded quantities and adjust any discrepancies.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
            
            
                Record any returned items in the store records, including reasons for returns. Update inventory levels accordingly.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
            
            
                Keep all store records organised and easily accessible. Regularly back up digital records and securely store physical documents.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
            
            
                Periodically review inventory reports to analyse stock levels, identify trends, and make informed decisions about reordering or discontinuing items.
