        <br><br>
        <ol>
            <li>
            
                <b class="list">The balance</b> is the fixed amount of money kept in the imprest account. It ensures there is always enough money available for small expenses.
            
                <br><br>
                <b>Example : </b>
                <br>
                In Nigeria, a company might maintain an imprest account with a balance of ₦100,000. This amount is set aside for small daily expenses, like office supplies or transportation costs. 
                The balance ensures that the company has enough funds available whenever these small costs arise.
            </li>
            <br><br>

            <li>
           
                <b class="list">Restoration</b> is the process of putting money back into the imprest account after you’ve spent some. This keeps the account at the original balance, so it’s ready for future payments.

                <br><br>
                <b>Example :</b>
                <br>
                After spending ₦30,000 from the imprest account on office supplies, the company would need to restore the account to its original balance of ₦100,000. To do this, they would collect receipts for the ₦30,000 spent and submit them for reimbursement. Once approved, 
                the company would deposit ₦30,000 back into the imprest account to bring it back to ₦100,000.
