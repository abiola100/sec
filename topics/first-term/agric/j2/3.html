        <ol>
            
            <li><b>Seed Propagation :</b>Plant seeds to grow new plants. Common for vegetables and grains. </li>
            <br>
            <li><b>Vegetative Propagation :</b>Use parts of a plant, like cuttings or tubers, to grow new plants.
                 Examples include potatoes,yam, and strawberries.</li>
                 <br>
            <li><b>Grafting and Budding :</b>Join parts of two plants to grow as one. Often used for fruit trees. </li>
            <br>
            <li><b>Layering :</b>Grow roots on a branch while still attached, then cut and plant it. Used for plants like roses.</li>
            <br>
            <li><b>Tissue Culture :</b>Grow new plants from small pieces of a plant in a clean environment.
                 Used to make many plants quickly.</li>

        <br><br>
        <ol>
            <li>
           
                 Seed propagation allows for natural variation, which can enhance disease resistance and adaptability.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                 Seeds are generally less expensive compared to other methods like cloning or grafting.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                 Seeds are compact, easy to store, and can be transported over long distances without damage.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                 Seeds are readily available for a wide range of crops and can be sourced easily from different suppliers.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                 Seeds can be sown in small spaces, allowing for easier management in small-scale or large-scale agriculture.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                 Seed propagation supports the natural growth process of plants, promoting healthy root development and strong plant structure.

        <ol>
            <li>
             
                Seeds may produce plants with different traits, leading to inconsistency in crop yield and quality.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Seeds take time to germinate and grow, delaying the time to harvest.
            </li> 
            <br>
            <li>
                Not all seeds may germinate successfully, leading to reduced plant population.
            </li> 
            <br>
            <li> 
                Seeds can carry diseases that may affect the plants once they start growing.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li> 
                Seedlings are more sensitive to environmental conditions, such as temperature and moisture, which can affect their survival.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Seed propagation often requires more time and effort, especially for sowing, watering, and care during early growth stages.
            </li>

            <li>  it allows for faster establishment of plants since they are started from parts that are already developed.</li>
            <br>
            <li> it ensures genetic consistency as the new plants are clones of the parent, maintaining desired characteristics.</li>
            <br>
            <li> methods like cuttings or grafting have higher rates of successful growth compared to seeds.</li>
            <br>
           <li> ensure retention of desirable traits, such as disease resistance or fruit quality, by maintaining the genetic makeup of the parent plant. </li>
           <br>
            <li>early harvesting is possible, as the plants begin with an already-established root system or structure.</li>
            <br>
         <li> for crops that are difficult to grow from seeds, vegetable propagation methods provide a reliable alternative, ensuring the continuity of production.</li>

        <br>

        <li>
          <b>Weed Management :</b>  Controlling weeds through mechanical methods (like hoeing and tilling) or chemical methods (using herbicides). Mulching can also help suppress weed growth.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
           <b> Fertilization :</b>Adding nutrients to the soil to promote plant growth. This can include organic fertilizers (compost, manure) or inorganic fertilizers (chemical fertilizers).

        <br>
        <li>
           <b>Pest and Disease Control :</b> Protecting crops from pests and diseases using integrated pest management (IPM), which includes biological control, chemical treatments, and cultural practices like crop rotation.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
           <b>Pruning and Training : </b> Removing dead or diseased plant parts and shaping plants to promote healthy growth. Training plants, especially vines and fruit trees, to grow in a desired direction.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            <b>Crop Rotation : </b>Growing different types of crops in the same area in sequential seasons. This helps prevent soil depletion and reduces pest and disease problems.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            <b>Mulching : </b>Applying a layer of material (like straw, leaves, or plastic) on the soil surface to retain moisture, control weeds, and regulate soil temperature.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            <b>Harvesting :</b>Collecting crops at the right stage of maturity to ensure the best quality and yield. Using proper techniques to avoid damaging the produce.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
