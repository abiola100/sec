        <h3>Meaning of Data</h3>
        <p>Data are raw facts, figures, symbols, or observations that have not yet been processed into a meaningful form. They are unorganized and may not have any immediate meaning until they are arranged or processed.</p>

        <p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
        <ol>
        <li>A list of students’ test scores before averaging them.</li><br>
        <li>Raw survey results, such as ages, names, or numbers collected from people.</li><br>
        </ol>

        <h3>Meaning of Information</h3>
        <p>Information is processed data — that is, data that has been arranged, interpreted, and presented in a way that makes sense to the user. When data is processed properly, it becomes useful information that can guide decisions.</p>

        <p><strong>Example:</strong><br>
        After processing the students’ scores, the teacher obtains their average, highest and lowest scores — this is now information.</p>

        <h3>Meaning of Data Processing</h3>
        <p>Data processing refers to the series of systematic actions performed on raw data to convert it into meaningful and useful information. It involves several steps such as collecting the data, checking and organizing it, entering it into a processing device, processing it according to instructions, and then producing results which can be used for decision-making.</p>
        <p>In other words, data processing means changing raw data into useful information.</p>

        <br><br>
        <div class="title" style="background-color: seagreen;color: white;"><b>STAGES OF DATA PROCESSING (Data Processing Cycle)</b></div>
        <p>Data processing usually follows a cycle known as the data processing cycle. Each stage depends on the previous one, and the accuracy of one stage affects the next. There are usually six main stages, although some sources include a seventh stage called distribution.</p>

        <h4>1. Data Collection (or Data Gathering)</h4>
        <p>This is the first stage of data processing. It involves obtaining or gathering raw data from different sources such as people, machines, or records. The data can be collected through questionnaires, forms, interviews, sensors, or observation.</p>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong> A school collects students’ names, subjects, and scores after examinations.</p>
        <p><strong>Importance:</strong></p>
        <ol>
        <li>Provides the basic material for processing.</li><br>
        <li>Ensures that all relevant facts are obtained before work begins.</li><br>
        </ol>

        <h4>2. Data Preparation (or Collation)</h4>
        <p>This is the stage where the collected data is organized, checked, and prepared for processing. It may include sorting, classifying, and validating the data to make sure it is correct and complete. Errors such as missing entries or duplicate records are corrected here.</p>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong> Arranging students’ names alphabetically and checking that all subjects have scores before typing them into a computer.</p>

        <h4>3. Data Input</h4>
        <p>This is the stage where the prepared data is entered into the computer system through input devices such as keyboard, mouse, scanner, or barcode reader. In manual systems, it could involve writing data into a record book or form. The aim of this stage is to convert the data into a machine-readable form.</p>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong> Typing students’ scores into an Excel sheet or database software.</p>

        <h4>4. Data Processing</h4>
        <p>This is the most important stage. Here, the entered data is manipulated according to instructions or programs to produce results. It involves performing calculations, comparisons, classifications, and summarizations. The processing is done by the Central Processing Unit (CPU) in a computer.</p>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong> Calculating totals, averages, or percentages; ranking students; generating summaries.</p>
        <p><strong>Methods of processing include:</strong></p>
        <ol>
        <li>Calculation</li><br>
        <li>Classification</li><br>
        <li>Sorting</li><br>
        <li>Summarizing</li><br>
        <li>Comparing</li><br>
        </ol>

        <h4>5. Data Output</h4>
        <p>This stage produces the final information from the processing stage. The output may be displayed on the screen, printed on paper, or stored as a digital file. It presents the data in a meaningful form that can be understood and used for decision-making.</p>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong> Printing a report card that shows each student’s name, scores, average, and position.</p>

        <h4>6. Data Storage</h4>
        <p>After the output is produced, the processed information and sometimes the original data are stored for future use. Storage may be temporary (for immediate use) or permanent (for reference, analysis, or backup). Storage devices include hard drives, flash drives, CDs, memory cards, or cloud storage.</p>
        <p><strong>Importance:</strong></p>
        <ol>
        <li>Makes it possible to retrieve data for future use.</li><br>
        <li>Ensures safety of important records.</li><br>
        </ol>

        <h4>7. Data Distribution (optional)</h4>
        <p>In some systems, the output information needs to be shared or distributed to the users who need it. Distribution may be done electronically (through email, internet, or network) or manually (through printed copies).</p>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong> Sending students’ results to parents through email or publishing them on a school portal.</p>

        <div class="title" style="background-color: darkolivegreen;color: white;"><b>TYPES OR METHODS OF DATA PROCESSING</b></div>
        <p>There are three main types or methods of data processing depending on the tools used.</p>

        <h4>1. Manual Data Processing</h4>
        <p>This is when data is processed by hand without the use of machines or computers. It involves the use of pen, paper, ruler, or calculator.</p>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong> A teacher calculating students’ total scores manually with a pen and paper.</p>
        <p><strong>Advantages:</strong></p>
        <ol>
