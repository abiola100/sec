        <h3> MEANING OF A COMPUTER</h3>
        <p>
        A computer is an electronic device that accepts data (raw facts) as input, processes the data according to a set of instructions (programs), stores it, and produces information (processed output) that is meaningful to the user.
        </p>
        <p>
        It helps us to perform complex calculations and make logical decisions at great speed and accuracy.
        </p>
        <p>
        In simple terms, a computer is a machine that can receive data, process it, and produce results automatically.
        </p>

        <h4>Definition of Data and Information</h4>
        <p><strong>Data:</strong> These are raw facts, figures, symbols, or numbers that have not yet been processed.<br>
        Example: scores of students before averaging them.</p>

        <p><strong>Information:</strong> This is the processed and meaningful result obtained from data.<br>
        Example: the class average after the scores have been processed.</p>

        <h3>2. MEANING OF HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF COMPUTER</h3>
        <p>
        The historical development of computer refers to the gradual process through which computers evolved from simple manual tools to the advanced electronic systems used today.
        </p>
        <p>
        It shows how man’s need to count, measure, and process data led to the invention of different machines over many centuries.
        </p>

        <br><br>
        <div class="title" style="background-color: seagreen;color: white;"><b>REASONS FOR STUDYING THE HISTORY OF COMPUTER</b></div>
        <p>Studying the history of computers helps us to:</p>
        <ol>
        <li>Understand how computer technology has changed over time.</li><br>
        <li>Appreciate the effort and creativity of early inventors.</li><br>
        <li>Know why computers have certain features and designs.</li><br>
        <li>Recognize how human needs influence technological development.</li><br>
        <li>Learn from past inventions and apply that knowledge to create new ones.</li><br>
        </ol><br><br><br>

        <div class="title" style="background-color: rosybrown;color: black;"><b>STAGES IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF COMPUTER</b></div>
        <p>The history of computers can be divided into five major stages:</p>
        <ol>
        <li>Early Counting Devices</li><br>
        <li>Mechanical Counting and Calculating Devices</li><br>
        <li>Electro-mechanical Devices</li><br>
        <li>Electronic Computers</li><br>
        <li>Generations of Computers</li><br>
        </ol>
        <p>Let us now study each stage in detail.</p>

        <h3>STAGE 1: EARLY COUNTING DEVICES</h3>
        <h4>Meaning</h4>
        <p>Early counting devices were simple tools and natural objects used by ancient people to count and keep records before the invention of machines. They were used mainly for trade, farming, and record keeping.</p>

        <h4>Examples</h4>
        <ol>
        <li>Fingers and toes</li><br>
        <li>Stones and pebbles</li><br>
        <li>Sticks and marks on walls or ground</li><br>
        <li>Cowries</li><br>
        <li>Grains or seeds</li><br>
        </ol>

        <h4>Explanation</h4>
        <p>In ancient times, man needed to count animals, food items, or objects during trade. At first, he used fingers and toes, but this was limited. To count larger quantities, man began to use pebbles, sticks, and cowries as counting aids. Marks were also made on bones, wood, or walls to keep permanent records. These methods marked the beginning of data representation and record keeping.</p>

        <h4>Features of Early Counting Devices</h4>
        <ol>
        <li>They were made from natural materials found around man.</li><br>
        <li>They were used manually without electricity or machines.</li><br>
        <li>Counting was done physically by moving or marking objects.</li><br>
        <li>They could handle only small numbers.</li><br>
        <li>They were mostly used for basic arithmetic operations like addition and subtraction.</li><br>
        </ol>

        <h4>Importance of Early Counting Devices</h4>
        <ol>
        <li>They formed the foundation of all future counting and computing methods.</li><br>
        <li>They helped humans to keep simple financial and agricultural records.</li><br>
        <li>They made it possible to measure and exchange goods during early trade.</li><br>
        <li>They helped humans to understand numbers and quantity representation.</li><br>
        <li>Their limitations encouraged people to invent better devices for faster counting.</li><br>
        </ol>

        <h4>Limitations of Early Counting Devices</h4>
        <ol>
        <li>They could only be used to count small quantities.</li><br>
        <li>Manual counting led to many errors.</li><br>
        <li>They could not store or retrieve previous results.</li><br>
        <li>Counting large items took too much time and effort.</li><br>
        <li>Pebbles, sticks, or cowries could be misplaced or destroyed easily.</li><br>
        </ol>

        <h3>STAGE 2: MECHANICAL COUNTING AND CALCULATING DEVICES</h3>
        <h4>Meaning</h4>
        <p>Mechanical counting devices are machines that use moving parts such as gears, levers, and wheels to perform arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. They marked the beginning of automation in counting.</p>

        <h4>Major Mechanical Devices and Inventors</h4>

        </ol>

        <h3>STAGE 3: ELECTRO-MECHANICAL DEVICES</h3>
        <h4>Meaning</h4>
        <p>Electro-mechanical devices combined mechanical movement with electrical components such as relays, switches, and motors to perform calculations automatically. They marked a major step towards modern computing because electricity made processing faster and more reliable.</p>

        <div class="title" style="background-color: sienna;color: white;"><b>GENERATIONS OF COMPUTER</b></div>

        <h3>Meaning of Computer Generation</h3>
        <p>
        The term <strong>generation of computer</strong> refers to the different stages of technological advancement in computer development. 
        Each generation marks a major improvement in the design, size, processing speed, storage capacity, cost, and reliability of computers. 
        The changes in computer generations were mainly due to the invention of new electronic components and technologies.
        </p>
        <p>
        There are <strong>five main generations of computers</strong>, and each generation introduced a new type of hardware technology that improved performance and usability.
        </p>

        <h3>THE FIVE GENERATIONS OF COMPUTER</h3>

        <p>
        The first generation of computers used <strong>vacuum tubes</strong> as the main electronic components for processing and storage. 
        Vacuum tubes controlled the flow of electricity inside the computer circuits.
        </p>

        <h4>Examples</h4>
