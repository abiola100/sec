        <h3>DEFINITION</h3>

        <p>Similar shapes are shapes that have the same shape but different sizes.</p>

        <p>This means that one of them can be bigger or smaller, but they look exactly alike.
        All the corners (angles) are the same, and the sides are in the same ratio.</p>

        <p><strong>For example:</strong><br>
        If you draw a small triangle and then draw a big triangle that looks exactly the same, they are called similar triangles.</p>

        <p><strong>In short:</strong><br>
        Similar shapes have the same shape but different sizes.</p>

        <h3>EXPLANATION</h3>

        <p>When two shapes are similar, it means:</p>

        <ol>
        <li>The shapes look exactly the same.</li><br>
        <li>Their angles (corners) are equal.</li><br>
        <li>The sides of one shape are longer or shorter than the sides of the other shape in the same ratio (proportion).</li><br>
        </ol>

        <p>If we make a shape bigger or smaller, it still remains similar as long as the sides and angles remain in the same order.</p>

       

        <p><strong>Example 1: Two Similar Triangles</strong></p>

<pre>
Small triangle:
    /\
   /  \
  /____\

Big triangle:
        /\
       /  \
      /____\
</pre>

<p>Both triangles look the same, but the big one is larger.<br>
They are similar triangles.</p>

<p><strong>Example 2: Two Similar Rectangles</strong></p>

<pre>
Small rectangle:
+------+
|      |
|      |
+------+

Big rectangle:
+------------+
|            |
|            |
+------------+
</pre>

        <p>Both rectangles have the same shape, but different sizes.<br>
        They are similar rectangles.</p>

        <p><strong>Example 3: Similar Circles</strong></p>

<pre>
Small circle:   ( )
Big circle:     (   )
</pre>

        <p>All circles look the same no matter how big or small they are.<br>
        All circles are similar.</p>

        <h3>MORE EXAMPLES OF SIMILAR SHAPES</h3>

        <ol>
        <li>Two squares of different sizes.</li><br>
        <li>Two rectangles with sides in the same ratio.</li><br>
        <li>Two equilateral triangles of different sizes.</li><br>
        <li>Two circles (because all circles have the same shape).</li><br>
        <li>Two cubes where all sides are in the same proportion.</li><br>
        </ol>

        <h3>SHAPES THAT ARE NOT SIMILAR</h3>

        <p>Two shapes are not similar if they do not look exactly alike.</p>

<p><strong>For example:</strong></p>

<pre>
Square:     +----+
            |    |
            +----+

Rectangle:  +--------+
            |        |
            +--------+
</pre>

        <p>The square and rectangle are not similar because their sides are not in the same proportion, even though they both have four sides.</p>

        <p>They are not similar.</p>

        <h3>PROPERTIES OF SIMILAR SHAPES</h3>

        <ol>
        <li>Their shapes are exactly the same.</li><br>
        <li>Their angles are equal.</li><br>
        <li>Their sides are in the same ratio (proportion).</li><br>
        <li>The sides that face each other (corresponding sides) are proportional.</li><br>
        <li>One shape can be an enlargement or a reduction of the other.</li><br>
        </ol>

        <h3>EXAMPLE (SHOWING RATIOS)</h3>

        <p>Look at these two triangles below:</p>

<pre>
Triangle PQR (small)     Triangle ABC (big)
PQ = 3 cm                AB = 6 cm
QR = 4 cm                BC = 8 cm
PR = 5 cm                AC = 10 cm
</pre>

        <p>Now, let us find the ratios of their sides:</p>

        <p>
        AB : PQ = 6 : 3 = 2 : 1<br>
        BC : QR = 8 : 4 = 2 : 1<br>
        AC : PR = 10 : 5 = 2 : 1
        </p>

        <p>The ratios are all the same (2 : 1).<br>
        Therefore, Triangle ABC is similar to Triangle PQR.</p>

        <div class="title" style="background-color: sienna;color: white;"><b>ENLARGEMENTS AND SCALE FACTOR (HOW SHAPES CHANGE SIZE)</b></div>

        <h3>DEFINITION</h3>
        <p>Enlargement means making a shape bigger or smaller, but keeping its shape the same.<br>
        It is like when you zoom in or zoom out on a picture — the picture becomes larger or smaller, but it still looks exactly the same.</p>

        <p><b>Scale Factor</b> is the number that tells us how much bigger or smaller the new shape is compared to the original one.</p>

        <p>If the scale factor is greater than 1, the shape becomes bigger.<br>
        If the scale factor is less than 1, the shape becomes smaller.</p>

        <h3>EXPLANATION</h3>
        <p>When we enlarge a shape:</p>
        <ol>
        <li>All the angles stay the same.</li><br>
        <li>The sides change length, but in the same ratio.</li><br>
        <li>The new shape is similar to the old one.</li><br>
        </ol>

        <p>So enlargement means “same shape, different size”.<br>
        The scale factor shows how many times larger or smaller the new shape is.</p>

        

        <p><b>Example 1: Enlargement of a Triangle</b></p>
        <p>Original triangle (small):</p>
<pre>
   /\
  /  \
 /____\
</pre>

<p>Enlarged triangle (big):</p>
<pre>
       /\
      /  \
     /____\
</pre>

        <p>The bigger triangle looks exactly the same, but it is larger.<br>
        This is called an enlargement.</p>

        <p><b>Example 2: Enlargement of a Rectangle</b></p>
        <p>Small rectangle:</p>
<pre>
+----+
|    |
+----+
</pre>

<p>Big rectangle:</p>
<pre>
+--------+
|        |
|        |
+--------+
</pre>

        <p>Both rectangles have the same shape, but the second one is bigger.<br>
        They are similar and one is an enlargement of the other.</p>

        <h3>WHAT IS A SCALE FACTOR?</h3>
        <p>The scale factor tells how much the shape has been enlarged or reduced.</p>
        <p><b>To find the scale factor, use:</b><br>
        Scale Factor = (Length of side in new shape) ÷ (Length of side in original shape)</p>

        <h3>EXAMPLE 1</h3>
        <p>A small square has sides 2 cm long.<br>
        A larger square has sides 6 cm long.</p>

        <p><b>Solution:</b><br>
        Scale factor = New side ÷ Original side<br>
        = 6 ÷ 2<br>
        = 3</p>

        <p> The scale factor is 3.<br>
        This means the big square is 3 times larger than the small one.</p>

        <h3>EXAMPLE 2</h3>
        <p>A small triangle has a side of 4 cm.<br>
        The enlarged triangle has a side of 8 cm.</p>
        <p>Scale factor = 8 ÷ 4 = 2<br>
        The new triangle is twice as big.</p>

        <h3>EXAMPLE 3</h3>
        <p>A small rectangle has a side of 10 cm.<br>
        The enlarged rectangle has a side of 5 cm.</p>
        <p>Scale factor = 5 ÷ 10 = 1/2<br>
         The new rectangle is half the size of the original.<br>
        It is a reduction (made smaller).</p>

        <h3>HOW TO KNOW IF IT IS ENLARGEMENT OR REDUCTION</h3>
        <table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="4">
        <tr><th>Type</th><th>What Happens</th><th>Scale Factor</th></tr>
        <tr><td>Enlargement</td><td>The shape becomes bigger</td><td>Greater than 1</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Reduction</td><td>The shape becomes smaller</td><td>Between 0 and 1</td></tr>
        </table>

        <h3>EXAMPLE 4 (WITH TWO DIMENSIONS)</h3>
        <p>A rectangle 4 cm long and 3 cm wide is enlarged by a scale factor of 2.</p>
        <p>New length: 4 × 2 = 8 cm<br>
        New width: 3 × 2 = 6 cm</p>
        <p> The new rectangle is twice as large in every direction.</p>

        <h3>EXAMPLE 5 (REDUCTION)</h3>
        <p>A triangle has sides of 6 cm, 8 cm, and 10 cm.<br>
        It is reduced by a scale factor of ½.</p>
        <p>New sides:<br>
        6 × ½ = 3 cm<br>
        8 × ½ = 4 cm<br>
        10 × ½ = 5 cm</p>
        <p> The new triangle is smaller, but still looks exactly the same.</p>

        <h3>IMPORTANT POINTS ABOUT ENLARGEMENT AND SCALE FACTOR</h3>
        <ol>
        <li>The new shape must have equal angles with the old shape.</li><br>
        <li>The sides are proportional (in the same ratio).</li><br>
        <li>The scale factor tells how much the shape has grown or shrunk.</li><br>
        <li>The centre of enlargement is the fixed point from which the shape grows or shrinks.</li><br>
        <li>If the scale factor = 1, the shape does not change size.</li><br>
        <li>If the scale factor > 1, the shape enlarges (gets bigger).</li><br>
        <li>If the scale factor < 1, the shape reduces (gets smaller).</li><br>
        </ol>

        <h3>SCALE FACTOR EFFECT</h3>

       <div class="title" style="background-color: #0b5a3a;color: white;"><b>LENGTHS, AREAS, AND VOLUMES OF SIMILAR SHAPES (RELATIONSHIPS AND CALCULATIONS)</b></div>

        <h3>DEFINITION</h3>

        <p>When two shapes are similar, it means:</p>
        <ol>
        <li>They have the same shape but different sizes.</li><br>
        <li>Their angles are equal.</li><br>
        <li>Their sides are in the same ratio (called the scale factor).</li><br>
        </ol>

        <p>Now, when shapes are similar, the lengths, areas, and volumes of the shapes are related in special ways.</p>
        <p>These relationships help us to find unknown measurements when we know the scale factor.</p>

        <h3>RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN LENGTHS, AREAS, AND VOLUMES</h3>

        <p>If two shapes are similar and their scale factor = k, then:</p>
        <ol>
        <li>The ratio of their lengths = k : 1</li><br>
        <li>The ratio of their areas = k² : 1</li><br>
        <li>The ratio of their volumes = k³ : 1</li><br>
        </ol>

        <p>This means:</p>
        <ol>
        <li>Lengths change in the same ratio as k.</li><br>
        <li>Areas change in the square of the ratio (k²).</li><br>
        <li>Volumes change in the cube of the ratio (k³).</li><br>
        </ol>

        <h3>EXPLANATION IN SIMPLE WORDS</h3>

        <p>Imagine you draw a small cube and a big cube that look exactly the same.</p>

        <p>If every side of the big cube is twice (2 times) the side of the small cube, then:</p>
        <ol>
        <li>The length of each side is 2 times longer.</li><br>
        <li>The area of each face is 2 × 2 = 4 times bigger.</li><br>
        <li>The volume is 2 × 2 × 2 = 8 times bigger.</li><br>
        </ol>

        <p>So when you make a shape bigger, the lengths, areas, and volumes grow much faster!</p>

        <h3>TEXT DIAGRAM EXAMPLES</h3>

        <p><b>Example 1: Lengths</b></p>
        <p>Small square (side = 2 cm)</p>

|  |
+--+
</pre>

<p>Big square (side = 4 cm)</p>
<pre>
+----+
|    |
|    |
+----+
</pre>

        <p>Scale factor = 4 ÷ 2 = 2<br>
        So, length ratio = 2 : 1</p>

        <p><b>Example 2: Areas</b></p>
        <p>Area of small square = 2 × 2 = 4 cm²<br><br>
        Area of big square = 4 × 4 = 16 cm²<br><br>
        Area ratio = 16 : 4 = 4 : 1<br><br>
        = (2²) : 1</p>
        <p>The area ratio = square of the scale factor (k²).</p>

        <p><b>Example 3: Volumes</b></p>
        <p>Small cube (side = 2 cm)<br><br>
        Volume = 2 × 2 × 2 = 8 cm³</p>

        <p>Big cube (side = 4 cm)<br><br>
        Volume = 4 × 4 × 4 = 64 cm³</p>

        <p>Volume ratio = 64 : 8 = 8 : 1<br>
        = (2³) : 1</p>
        <p>The volume ratio = cube of the scale factor (k³).</p>

        <h1>CONCLUSION</h1>

        <p>Understanding similar shapes, enlargements, and scale factor is very important in mathematics because it helps us to see how shapes can change size while keeping their shape the same. </p>

        <p>Key points to remember:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Similar shapes have the same shape but different sizes. Their corresponding angles are equal, and their sides are proportional.</li><br>
        <li>Enlargement means making a shape bigger or smaller while keeping the shape the same. Reduction is making a shape smaller.</li><br>
        <li>The scale factor tells us how much larger or smaller the new shape is compared to the original shape. A scale factor greater than 1 enlarges the shape, while a scale factor less than 1 reduces it.</li><br>
        <li>The lengths of similar shapes change in the ratio of the scale factor (k), areas change in the square of the scale factor (k²), and volumes change in the cube of the scale factor (k³).</li><br>
        <li>These concepts are used in real life in maps, drawings, models, photographs, and architecture to maintain proportions while changing size.</li><br>
        </ul>

        <p>By understanding and applying these rules, you can solve problems involving enlargements, scale factors, and similar shapes easily and accurately. It also prepares you for more advanced topics in geometry and measurement.</p>
