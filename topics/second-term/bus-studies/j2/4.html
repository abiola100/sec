       <div class="t2"><b>Meaning of Shopping</b></div>
        

        <p><strong>Shopping</strong> means the act of buying goods and services from shops, markets, or other places where they are sold. It involves selecting, paying for, and taking possession of goods or services that meet one’s needs and wants.</p>
        <p>In simple terms, shopping means going out to buy things that you need or want for personal or family use.</p>

        <h3><strong>Meaning of a Shopper</strong></h3>
        <p>A <strong>shopper</strong> is a person who buys goods and services from a shop, market, or any place of sale. For example, when you go to buy food, clothes, or stationery, you are a shopper.</p>

        <br><br>
        <div class="title" style="background-color: seagreen;color: white;"><b>Types of Shopping</b></div>
        <p>There are different types of shopping based on what is being bought or how it is done. They include:</p>

        <ol>
        <li><strong>Cash Shopping:</strong> This is when goods are paid for immediately after buying them. <br>Example: Buying bread from a bakery and paying cash on the spot.</li><br>

        <li><strong>Credit Shopping:</strong> This is when goods are collected and payment is made later. <br>Example: Buying items on credit from a shop and paying at the end of the month.</li><br>

        <li><strong>Window Shopping:</strong> This means looking at goods displayed in shops or markets without buying immediately. It helps the shopper to compare prices and quality before making a decision.</li><br>

        <li><strong>Online Shopping:</strong> This is the buying of goods and services through the internet using phones or computers. <br>Example: Buying clothes or shoes from online stores like Jumia or Konga.</li><br>

        <li><strong>Bulk Shopping:</strong> This means buying goods in large quantities, often at a cheaper price. <br>Example: Buying a full bag of rice instead of a few cups.</li><br>

        <li><strong>Impulse Shopping:</strong> This is when a person buys something without planning to, usually because of attraction to the product.</li><br>
        </ol><br>

        <div class="title" style="background-color: darkkhaki;color: black;"><b>Shopping Tips</b></div>
        <p><strong>Shopping tips</strong> are guidelines or pieces of advice that help a consumer to shop wisely and get the best value for money.</p>

        <div class="title" style="background-color: sienna;color: white;"><b>NEEDS AND WANTS</b></div>

        <h3><strong>Meaning of Needs</strong></h3>
        <p><strong>Needs</strong> are the basic things that a person must have in order to live a comfortable and healthy life. They are essential for survival and cannot be done without.</p>
        <p>Examples of needs include:</p>

        <ol>
        <li>Food</li><br>
        <li>Clothing</li><br>
        <li>Shelter</li><br>
        <li>Water</li><br>
        <li>Medical care</li><br>
        </ol>

        <p>Without these, a person cannot live properly or survive for long. Therefore, needs are also known as <strong>necessities of life</strong>.</p>

        <h3><strong>Meaning of Wants</strong></h3>
        <p><strong>Wants</strong> are the things that people desire to have but can live without. They make life more enjoyable and comfortable, but they are not essential for survival.</p>
        <p>Examples of wants include:</p>

        <ol>
        <li>Fancy clothes</li><br>
        <li>Television</li><br>
        <li>Car</li><br>
        <li>Smartphones</li><br>
        <li>Luxury furniture</li><br>
        <li>Jewellery</li><br>
        </ol>

        <p>Wants are unlimited because human desires never end. As one is satisfied, another arises.</p><br><br>

        <div class="title" style="background-color: seagreen;color: white;"><b>Differences Between Needs and Wants</b></div>
        <table >
        <tr>
        <th>Basis</th>
        <th>Needs</th>
        <th>Wants</th>
        </tr>

        <td>Very important and must be satisfied first</td>
        <td>Less important and can be postponed</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
        <td>Examples</td>
        <td>Food, clothing, shelter, water</td>
        <td>Car, television, gold chain</td>

        <td>May lead to suffering or death</td>

        </tr>
        <tr>
        <td>Satisfaction</td>
        <td>Must be satisfied to survive</td>
        <td>Can be satisfied to enjoy comfort</td>
        </tr>
        </table><br><br>

        <div class="title" style="background-color: darkkhaki;color: black;"><b>Characteristics of Needs and Wants</b></div>
        <ol>
        <li>Needs are essential for living, while wants are not.</li><br>
        <li>Wants are unlimited, but needs are limited.</li><br>
        <li>Wants vary from person to person, depending on taste, age, income, and environment.</li><br>
        <li>Needs must be satisfied first before wants.</li><br>
        <li>Both needs and wants require money to be satisfied.</li><br>
        <li>Wants can become needs if they are used frequently or become very important in daily life. <br>Example: A mobile phone may become a need for a businessperson.</li><br>
        </ol><br>

        <div class="title" style="background-color: darkolivegreen;color: white;"><b>Scale of Preference</b></div>
        <p>A <strong>scale of preference</strong> is a list of wants arranged in order of their importance or priority. It helps a person to decide which wants to satisfy first with the limited amount of money available.</p>
        <p>For example:</p>

        <table >
        <tr>
        <th>List of Wants</th>
        <th>Order of Importance</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
        <td>Food</td>
        <td>1st</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
        <td>School fees</td>
        <td>2nd</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
        <td>Clothes</td>
        <td>3rd</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
        <td>Shoes</td>
        <td>4th</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
        <td>Mobile phone</td>
        <td>5th</td>
        </tr>
        </table>

        <p>From the table, food is the most important and should be bought first.</p>

        <h3><strong>Opportunity Cost</strong></h3>
        <p><strong>Opportunity cost</strong> means the value of the next best alternative that is given up when a choice is made. It represents what you lose when you choose one thing instead of another.</p>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong> If you have ₦2,000 and you choose to buy a pair of shoes instead of a shirt, the shirt is the opportunity cost of the shoes.</p>

        <br><br>
        <div class="title" style="background-color: tan;color: black;"><b>Importance of Knowing Needs and Wants</b></div>
        <ol>
        <li>It helps you to spend money wisely.</li><br>
        <li>It helps in setting priorities.</li><br>
        <li>It encourages saving and good financial management.</li><br>
        <li>It prevents waste of money on unnecessary things.</li><br>
        <li>It helps to make better economic and personal decisions.</li><br>
        <li>It allows you to plan and live within your income.</li><br>
        <li>It teaches self-control and discipline in spending.</li><br>
        </ol><br>

        <div class="title" style="background-color: darkcyan;color: white;"><b>Factors that Influence Needs and Wants</b></div>
        <p>The needs and wants of people differ because of certain factors such as:</p>

        <ol>
        <li><strong>Age</strong> – The needs of children differ from those of adults.</li><br>
        <li><strong>Occupation</strong> – A farmer and an office worker have different needs and wants.</li><br>
        <li><strong>Income</strong> – A rich person can satisfy more wants than a poor person.</li><br>
        <li><strong>Environment</strong> – Climate and location affect what people need or want.</li><br>
        <li><strong>Education</strong> – Educated people may have different wants from uneducated people.</li><br>
        <li><strong>Culture and Religion</strong> – Beliefs and traditions influence what people consider important.</li><br>
        <li><strong>Technology</strong> – New inventions create new wants.</li><br>
        <li><strong>Peer Pressure and Advertisement</strong> – Influence people to buy things they may not need.</li><br>
        </ol><br>

        <div class="title" style="background-color: darkkhaki;color: black;"><b>Making Decisions About Needs and Wants</b></div>
        <p>Every individual must learn to make wise decisions about needs and wants because money and resources are limited. Decision-making helps a person to use available resources wisely and avoid waste.</p>
        <p>The following steps can guide you in making the right decisions:</p>

        <li><strong>Identify Your Needs and Wants:</strong> Know the difference between what you must have and what you simply desire.</li><br>
