        <h3>Meaning of Insurance</h3>
        <p>Insurance is an arrangement or system by which a person or business transfers the risk of loss or damage to an insurance company in exchange for the payment of a fee called a premium.</p>
        <p>It is a way of protecting individuals and businesses from unexpected losses such as fire, theft, accident, sickness, or death. The insurance company agrees to pay compensation to the insured person when a loss occurs.</p>
        <p>In simple terms, insurance means protection against loss.</p><br><br>

        <div class="title" style="background-color: #0b5a3a;color: white;"><b>Important Terms in Insurance</b></div>
        <ol>
        <li><strong>Insurer:</strong> The insurance company that provides insurance services and pays compensation when loss occurs. Example: AXA Mansard, Leadway Assurance, AIICO Insurance.</li><br>
        <li><strong>Insured:</strong> The person or business that buys insurance or is covered by an insurance policy.</li><br>
        <li><strong>Premium:</strong> The amount of money paid by the insured to the insurer at regular intervals (monthly, quarterly, or yearly) for the insurance cover.</li><br>
        <li><strong>Policy:</strong> A written document or contract that contains the terms, conditions, and details of the insurance agreement between the insurer and the insured.</li><br>
        <li><strong>Risk:</strong> The possibility of loss, damage, or injury.</li><br>
        <li><strong>Claim:</strong> A formal request made by the insured to the insurance company for compensation after a loss has occurred.</li><br>
        <li><strong>Compensation:</strong> The money paid by the insurance company to the insured after verifying that the loss or damage actually occurred.</li><br>
        <li><strong>Insurable Interest:</strong> The insured must have a financial or legal interest in the thing or person insured. Example: You can insure your car or your house, but not your neighbor’s car.</li><br>
        <li><strong>Indemnity:</strong> The principle that ensures the insured is restored to the same financial position as before the loss occurred — not to make profit.</li><br>
        <li><strong>Utmost Good Faith:</strong> Both the insurer and the insured must be honest and disclose all relevant facts when entering an insurance agreement.</li><br>
        <li><strong>Subrogation:</strong> After compensation has been paid, the insurance company has the right to take over any remaining claims or recoveries from the cause of the loss.</li><br>
        <li><strong>Contribution:</strong> If more than one insurance policy covers the same risk, each insurer shares the loss payment in proportion to the coverage.</li><br>
        </ol><br>

        <div class="title" style="background-color: sienna;color: white;"><b>Types of Insurance</b></div>
        <p>Insurance can be classified into two main categories:</p>

        <ol>
        <li><strong>Life Insurance (Personal Insurance):</strong> This type of insurance protects against the risk of death or provides financial security to the insured or their family. Examples include: <br><br>
        <ol>
            <li>Life Assurance</li><br>
            <li>Endowment Policy</li><br>
            <li>Education Policy</li><br>
            <li>Pension or Retirement Policy</li><br>
        </ol>
        </li><br>

        <li><strong>Non-Life Insurance (General Insurance):</strong> This covers other types of losses apart from death. Examples include: <br><br>
        <ol>
            <li>Fire Insurance: Covers losses caused by fire.</li><br>
            <li>Marine Insurance: Covers goods or ships lost or damaged at sea.</li><br>
            <li>Motor (Car) Insurance: Covers damage, theft, or accidents involving vehicles.</li><br>
            <li>Burglary or Theft Insurance: Covers loss caused by theft or burglary.</li><br>
            <li>Health or Medical Insurance: Covers medical expenses.</li><br>
            <li>Property Insurance: Covers buildings, furniture, or equipment.</li><br>
            <li>Goods-in-Transit Insurance: Covers goods being transported from one place to another.</li><br>
        </ol>
        </li><br>
        </ol>
           <div class="title" style="background-color: darkcyan;color: white;"><b>Principles of Insurance</b></div>

        
        <p>The major principles guiding insurance are:</p>
        <ol>
        <li><strong>Insurable Interest:</strong> The insured must have a legal and financial interest in the subject of insurance.</li><br>
        <li><strong>Utmost Good Faith:</strong> All parties must provide complete and truthful information.</li><br>
        <li><strong>Indemnity:</strong> The insured is compensated for actual loss only, not to make profit.</li><br>
        <li><strong>Subrogation:</strong> The insurer takes over the right to recover from a third party after paying compensation.</li><br>
        <li><strong>Contribution:</strong> When more than one policy covers the same risk, each insurer contributes a share of the payment.</li><br>
        <li><strong>Proximate Cause:</strong> The insurer is liable only for losses that are directly caused by the risk insured against.</li><br>
        </ol><br>

        <div class="title" style="background-color: darkkhaki;color: black;"><b>Importance of Insurance</b></div>
        <ol>
        <li>Provides financial protection against unexpected losses.</li><br>
        <li>Encourages savings because regular premium payments develop financial discipline.</li><br>
        <li>Promotes business confidence by reducing fear of loss.</li><br>
        <li>Helps to spread risk among many people or businesses.</li><br>
        <li>Provides compensation to victims of loss or damage.</li><br>
        <li>Promotes economic growth by encouraging investment and trade.</li><br>
        <li>Creates employment in insurance companies and agencies.</li><br>
        <li>Supports government revenue through taxes paid by insurance companies.</li><br>
        <li>Encourages safety and loss prevention through regular inspections and advice.</li><br>
        <li>Provides peace of mind for individuals and organizations.</li><br>
        </ol><br>
