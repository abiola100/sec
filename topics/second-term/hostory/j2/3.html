        <div class="title" style="background-color: purple;color: white;"><b> MALI EMPIRE</b></div>
        <h2> Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          The <b>Mali Empire </b> was one of the greatest empires in West Africa. It grew after the fall of the Ghana Empire around the 13th century A.D. and lasted until the 16th century A.D. The empire covered parts of what are today Mali, Senegal, Guinea, Niger, and Mauritania. Mali became famous because of its wealth, trade, strong rulers, Islamic learning, culture, and well-organized cities.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mali was known as a center of learning and scholarship, and its kings were respected for their justice, leadership, and support for Islam. Its trade in gold and salt made it rich and powerful.
        </p>

        <h2> Location</h2>
        <p>
        The <b>Mali Empire</b> was situated in West Africa, south of the Sahara Desert. Its location allowed the rulers to control important trade routes between North Africa and West Africa. These trade routes helped Mali become rich because merchants from North Africa brought salt, textiles, beads, and other goods, while Mali exported gold, kola nuts, ivory, and slaves.
        </p><br><br><br>
        <div class="title" style="background-color: seagreen;color: white;"><b>Some important cities of Mali were</b></div>
        
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Niani</strong> – the capital and center of administration.</li><br>
            <li><strong>Timbuktu</strong> – a center for Islamic learning, trade, and culture.</li><br>
            <li><strong>Gao</strong> – a trading city that connected Mali to other regions.</li><br>
            <li><strong>Djenne</strong> – famous for its markets and Islamic schools.</li>
        </ol><br><br><br>
        <div class="title" style="background-color: sienna;color: white;"><b>Political System</b></div>
        <p>Mali had a centralized government. The king, known as the <strong>Mansa</strong>, was the head of the empire. The Mansa had absolute power, but he was assisted by:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Ministers</strong> – who advised him and helped run the government.</li><br>
            <li><strong>Governors</strong> – who managed provinces and collected taxes.</li><br>
            <li><strong>Military leaders</strong> – who defended the empire and maintained peace.</li>
        </ol>

        <p><b>Society in Mali was hierarchical:</b></p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>King (Mansa) and royal family</strong> – rulers and advisors.</li><br>
            <li><strong>Nobles and military leaders</strong> – helped enforce laws and defend the empire.</li><br>
            <li><strong>Farmers, traders, and artisans</strong> – produced goods and contributed to trade.</li><br>
            <li><strong>Slaves</strong> – worked on farms, in households, or in mines.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>
        The army was very important. It protected trade routes, cities, and borders, making the empire safe for citizens and traders.
        </p><br><br><br>
         <div class="title" style="background-color: rosybrown;color: black;"><b>Economy of Mali empire </b></div>

        <h3>a. Trade</h3>
        <p>
        Trade was the main source of wealth in Mali. The empire was rich in gold and salt, which were highly demanded across Africa and beyond. Other goods included ivory, kola nuts, and slaves.
        </p>
        <p>
        Merchants from North Africa and Europe came to Mali to trade. Cities like Timbuktu, Gao, and Djenne were famous for their markets, where local and foreign traders exchanged goods. Mali’s control of trade routes made it a powerful and wealthy empire.
        </p>

        <h3>b. Agriculture</h3>
        <p>Farming was important for feeding the people and supporting trade.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Crops included millet, sorghum, rice, and vegetables.</li><br>
            <li>Livestock included cattle, goats, and sheep.</li><br>
            <li>Farmers contributed to the empire’s wealth and supported large populations in the cities.</li>
        </ol><br><br><br>
        
        <div class="title" style="background-color: tan;color: black;"><b>Religion of Mali empire</b></div>
        <p>
        Islam became the official religion of Mali, especially among rulers and traders. The Mansas, including Mansa Musa, were devout Muslims. Islam influenced law, education, and culture in the empire.
        </p>
        <p>
        However, many ordinary people continued practicing traditional African religions, worshipping ancestors and nature spirits.
        </p>
        <p>
        Mali became a center of Islamic learning, with mosques, Quranic schools, and libraries built in Timbuktu, Gao, and Djenne. Scholars from Mali traveled to North Africa and Arabia, spreading knowledge and learning.
