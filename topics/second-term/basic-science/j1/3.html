       <div class="t2"><b>Meaning of Energy</b></div>
       <p><b>Energy</b> is the capacity or ability to do work or cause change.</p>
       <p>Any time something moves, grows, heats up, produces light, makes sound, or operates a machine, energy is being used. Without energy, no activity can take place.</p>

       <br><br>
       <div class="title" style="background-color: sienna;color: white;"><b>FORMS OF ENERGY</b></div>

        <h3><strong>Mechanical Energy</strong></h3>

        <p><strong>Mechanical Energy</strong> This is the energy of moving objects. <br> <br> It is a form of energy that is related to motion and physical location. Mechanical energy is very important because it helps us understand how objects can do work, move, or cause other changes.</p>

        <p>There are two main types of mechanical energy:</p>

        <ol>
            <li><strong>Kinetic Energy:</strong>  is the energy of an object in motion. For example, a running boy, a moving car, or water flowing in a river all have kinetic energy because they are moving.</li><br>
            <li><strong>Potential Energy:</strong> This is the energy stored in an object because of its position or condition. For example, a stone held high above the ground or water stored in a dam has potential energy that can be released to do work.</li><br>
        </ol>

        <p>In short, <strong>mechanical energy</strong> is the total energy of motion (kinetic) and position (potential) in an object. It is everywhere around us and is used in daily life, from cars moving on the road to water turning turbines to produce electricity.</p>

        <h3><strong>Heat (Thermal) Energy</strong></h3>
        <p>This is the energy that makes things warm or hot. It comes from the sun, fire, electricity, or friction.</p>

        <h3><strong>Light Energy</strong></h3>
        <p>This is the energy that allows us to see. It comes from the sun, bulbs, candles, and fire.</p>

        <h3><strong>Chemical Energy</strong></h3>
        <p>This energy is stored in food, batteries, fuels such as petrol and gas, and it is released during chemical reactions.</p>

        <h3><strong>Electrical Energy</strong></h3>
        <p>This is the energy produced by electricity. It powers fans, televisions, fridges, phones, and other appliances.</p>

        <h3><strong>Sound Energy</strong></h3>
        <p>This is energy produced when objects vibrate. Examples are music, talking, drumming, or a ringing phone.</p>

        <h3><strong>Nuclear Energy</strong></h3>
        <p>This is energy stored inside the nucleus of atoms. It is released during nuclear reactions.</p>

        <h3><strong>Solar Energy</strong></h3>
        <p>This is energy that comes from the sun. It can be converted to electricity by using solar panels.</p>

        <br><br>

        <div class="title" style="background-color: darkolivegreen;color: white;"><b>SOURCES OF ENERGY</b></div>

        <ol>

        <li><strong>The Sun:</strong> The sun is the major natural source of energy for the entire Earth. It gives out light and heat, which living things need in order to survive. Plants use sunlight to make their own food, and humans use solar panels to convert sunlight to electrical energy.</li><br>

        <li><strong>Food:</strong> Food provides chemical energy for all living things. When humans and animals eat food, the body breaks it down and releases energy that helps them to move, grow, think, breathe, and carry out other activities.</li><br>

        <li><strong>Fuels:</strong> Fuels such as petrol, diesel, kerosene, gas, and charcoal contain chemical energy. This energy is released when they burn. Fuels are used for cooking, driving vehicles, powering generators, heating, and industrial work.</li><br>

        <li><strong>Batteries:</strong> Batteries store chemical energy, which changes to electrical energy when the battery is in use. Batteries are used in torches, phones, radios, clocks, and many other devices, especially when there is no electricity supply.</li><br>

        <li><strong>Water:</strong> Moving water, especially in dams, is used to generate electricity. The fast-moving water turns turbines, and the turbines produce electrical energy. This is known as hydro-electric power and it is a clean, renewable source of energy.</li><br>

        <li><strong>Wind:</strong> Wind has moving energy. When wind blows, it spins the blades of wind turbines. The movement of the blades is converted into electrical energy. Wind energy is renewable and does not cause pollution.</li><br>

        <li><strong>Electricity:</strong> Electricity is a major source of energy for machines and appliances. It powers fans, televisions, refrigerators, computers, lamps, and industrial machines. Electricity can come from water, wind, fuel, or the sun.</li><br>

        </ol>

        <br>

            <li>Mechanical energy changes to electrical energy in hydro-electric power.</li><br>
            <li>Chemical energy changes to heat when fuel burns.</li><br>
            <li>Solar energy changes to electrical energy in solar panels.</li><br>
        </ol>

        <br>

            <li>Walk for short distances instead of using vehicles.</li><br>
            <li>Use solar energy where possible.</li><br>
        </ol>

        <br>

        <br>

      
        <div class="title" style="background-color: darkolivegreen;color: white;"><b>FORMS OF ENERGY IN THE HUMAN BODY</b></div>

        <p>Humans obtain chemical energy from the food that they eat. When food is digested, the body releases the stored chemical energy and uses it to carry out many important activities that keep a person alive and healthy. This chemical energy is very important because it powers every action and process in the human body.</p>

        <p>This energy helps the body to:</p>

        <ol>
            <li><strong>Grow:</strong> Chemical energy from food is used to build new cells and repair old or damaged ones. This allows the body to increase in size and stay healthy.</li><br>

            <li><strong>Move:</strong> The muscles use energy from food to contract and relax. This allows humans to walk, run, lift objects, write, and perform all forms of physical activity.</li><br>

            <li><strong>Think:</strong> The brain needs a constant supply of energy from food in order to work properly. This energy helps humans to think, learn, remember, and make decisions.</li><br>

            <li><strong>Fight diseases:</strong> The body’s immune system uses energy to protect the body from germs and infections. Without enough energy, the body will become weak and unable to defend itself.</li><br>

            <li><strong>Stay warm:</strong> Energy from food helps the body to maintain its temperature. Even when the weather is cold, the body uses chemical energy to produce heat and keep itself warm.</li><br>
        </ol>


        <br>

        <div class="title" style="background-color: sienna;color: white;"><b>MEASUREMENT OF ENERGY</b></div>

        <p>Energy isn't guessed or estimated; it is measured using standard units so that scientists and everyone else can know exactly how much energy is being used or produced. The basic unit for measuring energy is called the <strong>Joule (J)</strong>. This unit is used all over the world.</p>

        <p>Sometimes energy can be very large, so bigger units are used:</p>

        <p><strong>Kilojoules (kJ):</strong> One kilojoule is equal to one thousand joules. This unit is commonly used to measure the energy in food because the body uses large amounts of energy.</p>

        <p><strong>Megajoules (MJ):</strong> One megajoule is equal to one million joules. This unit is used when measuring very large amounts of energy, such as in engines, factories, or power stations.</p>

        <p>Therefore, energy can be measured in:</p>

        <ol>
            <li><strong>Joules (J)</strong> – the smallest standard unit of energy.</li><br>
            <li><strong>Kilojoules (kJ)</strong> – one thousand joules.</li><br>
            <li><strong>Megajoules (MJ)</strong> – one million joules.</li><br>
        </ol>

        <p>These units help scientists and engineers to know exactly how much energy is needed for different activities, machines, or processes.</p>

        <br><br>

        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>Energy is the ability to do work or cause change. It exists in many forms, including mechanical, heat, light, chemical, electrical, sound, nuclear, and solar energy. Energy can be transformed, conserved, and measured, and it helps us to carry out daily activities and bodily functions.</p>
