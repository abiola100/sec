        <div class="t2"><b>INTRODUCTION</b></div>
        <p><b>Plants and animals</b> are living things. Living things show certain characteristics such as growth, movement, reproduction, response to stimuli, nutrition, respiration, excretion and death. Studying plants and animals helps to understand the natural world and how organisms interact.</p>

        <div class="title" style="background-color: sienna;color: white;"><b>PLANTS</b></div>

        <p><strong> MEANING OF PLANTS</strong></p>
        <p>Plants are living things that make their own food through photosynthesis. They contain chlorophyll, remain fixed in one place, and their cells have cell walls.</p>

        </ol><br>

        <div class="title" style="background-color: darkcyan;color: white;"><b> PROCESSES IN PLANTS</b></div>

        <p><strong>A. Photosynthesis</strong></p>
        <p>Photosynthesis is the process by which green plants make their own food. It happens in the leaves because the leaves contain chlorophyll, a green pigment that traps sunlight. During photosynthesis, plants use three main things: sunlight, water from the soil, and carbon dioxide from the air. With the help of chlorophyll, these materials are combined to produce glucose (a simple sugar) as food. Oxygen is released as a waste product. Photosynthesis is very important because it helps plants to grow and also provides oxygen for animals and humans.</p>

        <p><strong>B. Transpiration</strong></p>
        <p>Transpiration is the loss of water vapour from the leaves of plants. Water taken up by the roots travels through the stem to the leaves. Some of this water is used for photosynthesis, but most of it is lost through tiny openings on the leaves called stomata. Transpiration helps to cool the plant, helps the movement of water from the roots upward, and also helps the plant to maintain its shape.</p>

        <p><strong>C. Respiration</strong></p>
        <p>Respiration is the process by which plants break down the food they have made in order to release energy for growth, repair, and other activities. During respiration, plants take in oxygen and release carbon dioxide and water. Plants respire both during the day and at night, but the process is more noticeable at night because photosynthesis does not take place without sunlight.</p>

        <p><strong>D. Nutrition</strong></p>
        <p>Nutrition in plants refers to the way plants obtain and use food. Plants produce their own food through photosynthesis, so they are called autotrophs. This type of feeding is known as autotrophic nutrition. The food they produce gives them the energy they need to grow, reproduce, and carry out life processes.</p><br><br>

        <br><br>

        <div class="title" style="background-color: darkkhaki;color: black;"><b> PLANT REPRODUCTION</b></div>

        <p>Plant reproduction is the process by which plants produce new plants. There are two major types of reproduction in plants: <strong>sexual reproduction</strong> and <strong>asexual (vegetative) reproduction</strong>.</p>

        <p><strong>1. Sexual Reproduction</strong></p>
        <p>Sexual reproduction in plants involves the use of <strong>flowers</strong>. It requires male and female reproductive cells to come together to form seeds. The process occurs in stages:</p>

        <ol>
        <li><strong>Pollination:</strong> This is the transfer of pollen grains (male cells) from the anther to the stigma of a flower. It can happen by wind, insects, water, or animals.</li><br>

        <li><strong>Fertilisation:</strong> After pollination, the pollen grain travels down the style to meet the ovule (female cell) inside the ovary. When the male cell fuses with the female cell, fertilisation takes place.</li><br>

        <li><strong>Seed Formation:</strong> After fertilisation, the ovule develops into a seed. The seed contains a baby plant (embryo) and food for the embryo.</li><br>

        <li><strong>Fruit Formation:</strong> The ovary of the flower grows and becomes a fruit. The fruit protects the seed and helps in seed dispersal.</li><br>
        </ol>

        <p>Therefore, the order is: <strong>Pollination → Fertilisation → Seed formation → Fruit formation</strong>.</p>

        <br>

        <p><strong>2. Asexual (Vegetative) Reproduction</strong></p>
        <p>Asexual reproduction does not require flowers or seeds. A new plant grows from a part of the parent plant. The new plant is exactly like the parent plant. It is faster and more reliable than sexual reproduction.</p>

        <ol>
        <li><strong>Budding:</strong> A small part of the plant grows out of the parent plant and later breaks off to form a new plant (for example, yeast, some plants).</li><br>

        <li><strong>Grafting:</strong> A stem of one plant is attached to the stem of another plant. This is used for fruit trees like citrus and mango.</li><br>

        <li><strong>Cutting:</strong> A part of a plant, usually the stem or leaf, is cut and planted in the soil to grow into a new plant (for example, hibiscus, sugarcane).</li><br>

        <li><strong>Layering:</strong> A branch of a plant is bent to touch the soil. It forms roots while still attached to the parent plant, and later becomes a new plant.</li><br>

        <li><strong>Runners:</strong> These are special stems that grow along the ground. They form new plants at points where they touch the soil (for example, strawberry, sweet potato).</li><br>

        <li><strong>Tubers:</strong> Underground swollen stems that store food. New plants grow from their "eyes" or buds (for example, yam, potato).</li><br>
        </ol><br>


        <div class="title" style="background-color: seagreen;color: white;"><b>IMPORTANCE OF PLANTS</b></div>
        <ol>
        <li>They provide food (fruits, vegetables, grains).</li><br>
        <li>They release oxygen needed for breathing.</li><br>

        <div class="title" style="background-color: sienna;color: white;"><b>ANIMALS</b></div>

        <p><strong> MEANING OF ANIMALS</strong></p>
        <p>Animals are living things that cannot make their own food. They depend on plants or other animals, move from place to place, and have sense organs.</p>

        <br><br>
        <div class="title" style="background-color: darkkhaki;color: black;"><b> CHARACTERISTICS OF ANIMALS</b></div>
        <ol>
        <li>They cannot make their own food (heterotrophic).</li><br>
        <li>They move from place to place.</li><br>
        <li>Their cells do not have cell walls.</li><br>
        <li>They have sense organs.</li><br>
        <li>They respond quickly to stimuli.</li><br>
        <li>They store food as glycogen or fat.</li><br>
        <li>They show complex behaviour.</li><br>
        </ol><br>

        <div class="title" style="background-color: seagreen;color: white;"><b>CLASSIFICATION OF ANIMALS</b></div>

       <p><strong>A. Vertebrates (animals with backbone)</strong></p>
        <p>Vertebrates are animals that have a backbone (spinal column) made of vertebrae. This backbone supports their body, protects the spinal cord, and allows for movement. Vertebrates are further divided into different groups:</p>
        <ol>
        <li><strong>Fish</strong> – Live in water and breathe using gills. They usually have fins for swimming and scales covering their body. Examples include tilapia, catfish, and salmon.</li><br>
        <li><strong>Amphibians</strong> – Can live both on land and in water. They have moist skin and breathe through both lungs and their skin. Examples include frogs, toads, and salamanders.</li><br>
        <li><strong>Reptiles</strong> – Have dry, scaly skin and usually lay eggs on land. They are cold-blooded and breathe using lungs. Examples include snakes, lizards, and crocodiles.</li><br>
        <li><strong>Birds</strong> – Have feathers, wings, and lay eggs. Most birds can fly and have beaks adapted to their feeding habits. Examples include sparrows, eagles, and pigeons.</li><br>
        <li><strong>Mammals</strong> – Give birth to live young ones and produce milk to feed their babies. They are warm-blooded and usually have hair or fur. Examples include humans, cows, and lions.</li><br>
        </ol>

        <p><strong>B. Invertebrates (animals without backbone)</strong></p>
        <p>Invertebrates are animals that do not have a backbone. They make up the largest group of animals on Earth. Some common types are:</p>
        <ol>
        <li><strong>Insects</strong> – Small animals with six legs and three body parts (head, thorax, abdomen). Examples: ants, butterflies, bees.</li><br>
        <li><strong>Worms</strong> – Soft-bodied, elongated animals that live in soil or water. Examples: earthworms, tapeworms.</li><br>
        <li><strong>Molluscs</strong> – Soft-bodied animals, many have shells. Examples: snails, clams, octopus.</li><br>
        <li><strong>Arthropods</strong> – Animals with jointed legs and segmented bodies. Most have an exoskeleton. Examples: centipedes, millipedes.</li><br>
        <li><strong>Crustaceans</strong> – Mostly aquatic animals with hard shells and jointed legs. Examples: crabs, lobsters, shrimps.</li><br>
        <li><strong>Arachnids</strong> – Animals with eight legs and no antennae. Examples: spiders, scorpions, ticks.</li><br>
        </ol><br>


        <div class="title" style="background-color: rosybrown;color: black;"><b>SYSTEMS IN ANIMALS</b></div>
        <ol>
       
        <ol>
        <li><strong>Digestive system</strong> – This system is responsible for breaking down food into nutrients that the body can absorb and use for energy, growth, and repair. It includes the mouth, esophagus, stomach, intestines, liver, and pancreas.</li><br>

        <li><strong>Respiratory system</strong> – This system allows animals to take in oxygen from the environment and release carbon dioxide. It includes the lungs, trachea, and diaphragm in mammals, while fish use gills for breathing.</li><br>

        <li><strong>Circulatory system</strong> – Also called the cardiovascular system, it transports blood, nutrients, oxygen, and waste products around the body. It includes the heart, blood vessels (arteries, veins, capillaries), and blood.</li><br>

        <li><strong>Excretory system</strong> – This system removes waste products from the body to maintain a stable internal environment. It includes the kidneys, ureters, bladder, and urethra in mammals, and other organs in different animals.</li><br>

        <li><strong>Nervous system and sense organs</strong> – This system controls body activities and responds to changes in the environment. The nervous system includes the brain, spinal cord, and nerves, while sense organs (eyes, ears, nose, tongue, skin) detect stimuli like light, sound, smell, taste, and touch.</li><br>

        <li><strong>Reproductive system</strong> – This system allows animals to produce offspring to continue their species. In mammals, it includes the testes, penis, ovaries, and uterus. Other animals have different reproductive organs, but all produce gametes (sperm and eggs).</li><br>

        <li><strong>Skeletal and muscular systems</strong> – The skeletal system provides support, protection, and shape to the body. It includes bones, cartilage, and joints. The muscular system allows movement by contracting and relaxing muscles, which are attached to bones.</li><br>
        </ol><br>


        <div class="title" style="background-color: darkolivegreen;color: white;"><b> MODES OF FEEDING IN ANIMALS</b></div>
        <ol>
        <li>Herbivores – feed on plants.</li><br>
        <li>Carnivores – feed on flesh.</li><br>
        <li>Omnivores – feed on plants and animals.</li><br>
        <li>Parasites – live on other organisms.</li><br>
        <li>Detritivores – feed on dead matter.</li><br>
        </ol><br>

        <div class="title" style="background-color: darkkhaki;color: black;"><b>ANIMAL ADAPTATION</b></div>
        <p>Animal adaptation refers to the changes in the body structure, behaviour, or physiology of animals that help them survive in their specific environment. Adaptations allow animals to find food, avoid predators, reproduce, and cope with climate conditions. Some common examples include:</p>

        <ol>
        <li><strong>Thick fur for cold regions:</strong> Animals like polar bears, arctic foxes, and snow leopards have thick fur to keep them warm in freezing temperatures. The fur traps heat and protects them from cold winds.</li><br>

        <li><strong>Webbed feet for swimming:</strong> Animals such as ducks, frogs, and otters have webbed feet which act like paddles. This adaptation helps them swim efficiently in water and catch food.</li><br>

        <li><strong>Camouflage for hiding:</strong> Some animals have colours or patterns that blend with their surroundings. For example, chameleons, tigers, and leaf insects use camouflage to hide from predators or sneak up on prey.</li><br>

        <li><strong>Long neck for reaching tall trees:</strong> Animals like giraffes have long necks which allow them to feed on leaves that are high up in tall trees. This adaptation reduces competition for food with animals that can only reach low plants.</li><br>
        </ol>

        <p>In general, adaptations can be <strong>structural</strong> (physical features like thick fur or webbed feet), <strong>behavioural</strong> (actions like hibernation or migration), or <strong>physiological</strong> (internal processes like producing antifreeze in blood).</p>


        <div class="title" style="background-color: darkcyan;color: white;"><b>IMPORTANCE OF ANIMALS</b></div>
        <ol>
        <li>They provide food (meat, milk, eggs).</li><br>
        <li>They provide raw materials (leather, wool, silk).</li><br>
        <li>They help with transport (horse, camel).</li><br>
        <li>They help in farming (ploughing).</li><br>
        <li>They serve as pets.</li><br>
