        <div class="t2"><b>Meaning of Drama</b></div><br>
        <p>
            <b>Drama</b> is a type of performance where people act out real or imagined events in front of an audience. It is done using spoken words, actions, gestures, and sometimes music or dance. The aim is to tell a story, teach a lesson, or entertain. Drama shows life as it is or as it could be, using characters to express emotions, struggles, or ideas.
        </p>
        <div class="topic-image"><img src="../../../../images/drama.avif" alt=""></div>
        <p>
            In drama, the performers are called actors or actresses, and the place where the performance happens is usually called the stage. Everything they say and do is guided by a written script called a play.
        </p><br>
        <div class="t2"><b>Meaning of Theatre</b></div>
        <p>
            <b>Theatre</b> is the building or space where drama is performed, but it also means the <b>complete art of putting a drama into action. </b> This includes acting, directing, stage designing, costuming, lighting, music, makeup, and the presence of an audience.
        </p>
         <div class="topic-image"><img src="../../../../images/Theatre.jpeg" alt=""></div>
        <p>
            So, while drama is the story and action, theatre is the combination of everything needed to bring that story to life on stage.

        <div class="title" style="background-color: seagreen;color: white;"><b>Elements of Drama</b></div>
        <div>Drama has many important parts (called elements) that work together to make the story come alive. These include:</div>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Plot </b> – This is the main story of the drama. It shows how events happen from the beginning to the end. It has a beginning (introduction), a middle (conflict or problem), and an end (solution or resolution).</li><br>
            <li><b>Characters  </b>– These are the people or roles being acted in the drama. Every character has a purpose or role to play in the story.</li><br>
            <li><b>Dialogue  </b>– This refers to the words spoken by the characters in the play. Good dialogue helps the audience understand the story and the characters' emotions.</li><br>
            <li><b>Conflict </b> – This is the problem or struggle in the drama. It can be a fight between people, a challenge, or an emotional problem. Conflict makes the story interesting and keeps the audience engaged.</li><br>
            <li><b>Theme </b> – This is the main idea or message of the drama. It could be love, hate, greed, peace, poverty, honesty, or betrayal — depending on what the play is teaching.</li><br>
            <li><b>Setting </b> – This shows where and when the story takes place. It tells whether the drama is happening in the past, present, or future, and in what location — like a village, school, or city.</li><br>
            <li><b>Mood and Atmosphere </b> – This is the emotional feeling the drama creates. It could be sad, joyful, scary, or tense.</li><br>
            <li><b>Costume and Makeup </b> – These help show what kind of person each character is. Costumes are the clothes the actors wear, while makeup changes their appearance to look older, younger, sick, poor, or rich.</li><br>
            <li><b>Stage Direction </b> – These are instructions in the script that tell the actors what to do, where to go, or how to speak and act. It also tells where props should be placed.</li><br>
            <li><b>Sound and Music </b> – Sounds and background music make the play feel more real. For example, thunder sounds in a storm scene or sad music in an emotional moment.</li>
        </ol><br><br><br>
        <div class="title" style="background-color: darkolivegreen;color: white;"><b>Types of Drama</b></div>
