        <div class="t2"><b>Definition of Music</b></div>
        <p>
            Music is an art form that combines sounds in a way that is pleasing to the ears. It involves melody, rhythm, harmony, and expression.
        </p>

        <br><br>
        <div class="title" style="background-color: brown;color: white;"><b>Origin of Music</b></div>
        <p>
            Music has been part of human life since ancient times. Early humans created music naturally by clapping their hands, beating on objects like drums, blowing simple horns, and singing with their voices. These basic sounds were used for enjoyment, to communicate with one another, and during early forms of worship and celebration.

        </p><br><br><br>
        <div class="title" style="background-color: darkcyan;color: white;"><b>Historical Periods of Music</b></div>
        <p>
            Over time, music developed through several major periods in history, each with its own style and purpose.
        </p><br>
        <div class="t2"><b>Ancient Music (Before 500 AD):</b></div>
        <p>
            In this <b>early period, </b> music was mostly used for rituals, worship, and communication. People in ancient civilizations like Egypt and Mesopotamia used instruments such as drums, flutes, and harps during religious ceremonies and traditional events.
        </p><br>
        <div class="t2"><b>Medieval Music (500–1400 AD):</b></div>
        <p>
            During the medieval period, music was mainly religious and performed in churches. One popular type of church music was the Gregorian chant. Instruments commonly used at this time included the lute, harp, and early forms of the violin.
        </p>
        <div class="t2"><b>Renaissance Music (1400–1600 AD):</b></div>
        <p>
            This period saw the rise of more complex musical harmonies and the beginning of secular (non-religious) music. Music became more expressive, and famous composers like Giovanni Palestrina became known for their beautiful compositions.
        </p>
        <div class="t2"><b>Baroque Music (1600–1750 AD):</b></div>
        <p>
            Baroque music was known for its rich, decorated, and elaborate style. It featured many musical ornaments and dramatic contrasts. Great composers from this era include Johann Sebastian Bach and George Frideric Handel.
        </p>
        <div class="t2"><b>Classical Music (1750–1820 AD):</b></div>
        <p>Music from the classical period was structured and balanced. It focused on clear melodies and proper form. Famous classical composers include Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and Ludwig van Beethoven.</p>

        <div class="t2"><b>Romantic Music (1820–1900 AD):</b></div>
        <p>In the romantic period, music became more emotional and expressive. Composers used music to show personal feelings and dramatic stories. Some well-known romantic composers are Frederic Chopin and Franz Schubert.</p>

        <div class="t2"><b>Modern Music (20th Century to Present):</b></div>
        <p>Modern music includes many different styles such as jazz, pop, rock, hip-hop, and electronic music. This period brought about rapid changes and the spread of global musical styles. In Nigeria, this period includes popular genres like Highlife, Juju, and Afrobeat, made famous by artists such as Fela Kuti.</p>
         <div class="t2"><b>Music in Nigeria</b></div>
         <p>In Nigeria, music plays an important role in culture and tradition. Traditional Nigerian music is used during festivals, ceremonies, and important events. Instruments like the Bata drum, Ekwe, and Ogene are common in many local communities. During the colonial period, Western instruments such as the piano and guitar were introduced into Nigerian music. Today, modern Nigerian music includes popular genres such as Afrobeats, gospel, and Fuji, with famous musicians like Wizkid and Burna Boy gaining international recognition.</p>
