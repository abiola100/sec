        <div class="title01" style="background-color: purple;color: white;"><b>THE AMALGAMATION OF NIGERIA (1914)</b></div>
        <div class="t2"><b>Meaning of Amalgamation</b></div><br>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Amalgamation</b> means the joining together of two or more territories, regions, or states to form a single political unit.</li><br>
            <li>In Nigerian history, amalgamation refers to the <b>merger of the Colony of Lagos, the Southern Protectorate, and the Northern Protectorate into one single country called Nigeria in 1914.</b></li><br>
            <li>The amalgamation was carried out by <b>Sir Frederick Lugard, </b>who became the first Governor-General of Nigeria. </li>
        </ul><br><br><br>
        <div class="title" style="background-color: seagreen;color: white;"><b>Background to the Amalgamation</b></div>
       <ul>
        <li>Before 1914, Nigeria was not a single country. It was divided into three separate administrations:</li><br>
        <ol>
            <li>The <b>Colony of Lagos</b> (since 1861).</li><br>
            <li>The <b>Southern Protectorate.</b></li><br>
            <li>The <b>Northern Protectorate. </b></li><br>
        </ol>
        <li>Each had its own government and finances.</li><br>
        <li>The British government decided to merge them for economic and administrative reasons. </li>
       </ul><br><br><br>
        <div class="title" style="background-color: darkcyan;color: white;"><b>Features of the 1914 Amalgamation</b></div>
        <ol>
            <li>A <b>Governor-General</b> was appointed (Sir Frederick Lugard).</li><br>
            <li>Nigeria became one political entity, though still under British colonial rule.</li><br>
            <li>The <b>North and South  </b>maintained separate administrations but were controlled by the central government.</li><br>
            <li>Lagos remained the <b>capital of Nigeria. </b></li><br>
            <li>The colonial government introduced the system of <b>Indirect Rule </b> as the main method of administration.</li>
        </ol>
       
       <br><br><br>
       <div class="title" style="background-color: sienna;color: white;"><b>REASONS FOR THE AMALGAMATION OF NIGERIAN TERRITORIES</b></div>
       <p>The <b>Amalgamation of 1914</b> joined the Colony of Lagos, the Protectorate of Southern Nigeria, and the Protectorate of Northern Nigeria into one political unit called <b>Nigeria. </b>It was carried out by <b>Lord Frederick Lugard, </b> the first Governor-General of Nigeria.</p>
       <p>The main reasons for the amalgamation were:</p>
       <ol>
        <li><b>Economic Reasons</b> <br><br>
            <ul>
            <li>The Northern Protectorate was poor and could not generate enough revenue to sustain its administration.</li><br>
            <li>The South, especially Lagos and the Niger Delta, was economically viable, earning high income from palm produce, cocoa, and trade.</li><br>
            <li>Amalgamation allowed the use of revenue from the South to fund the North, thereby reducing Britain’s financial burden.</li><br>
            </ul>
        </li>

        <li><b>Administrative Convenience</b> <br><br>
            <ul>
            <li>Managing three separate territories (Colony of Lagos, Southern Protectorate, and Northern Protectorate) was expensive and difficult.</li><br>
            <li>Merging them into a single administrative unit made governance cheaper and more efficient.</li><br>
            <li>It also allowed Britain to centralize policies and administration across Nigeria.</li><br>
            </ul>
        </li>

        <li><b>Communication and Transportation</b> <br><br>
            <ul>
            <li>Amalgamation made it easier to connect railways, roads, and waterways between the North and South.</li><br>
            <li>This was important for trade, military movement, and administration.</li><br>
            <li>For example, railway lines from Lagos to Kano were better managed under a single government.</li><br>
            </ul>
        </li>

        <li><b>Unification of Policies and Laws</b> <br><br>
            <ul>
            <li>Before 1914, the North and South had different laws, taxation systems, and trade regulations.</li><br>
            <li>Amalgamation helped harmonize policies, making the administration of justice, trade, and taxation uniform across Nigeria.</li><br>
            </ul>
        </li>

        <li><b>Strengthening British Control</b> <br><br>
            <ul>
            <li>By uniting the territories, Britain created a bigger and stronger colony under its control.</li><br>
            <li>This helped to prevent French or German encroachment in Nigerian territories.</li><br>
            <li>A united Nigeria increased the prestige of the British Empire.</li><br>
            </ul>
        </li>

        <li><b>Military and Security Reasons</b> <br><br>
            <ul>
            <li>It was easier for Britain to defend a single large colony than separate protectorates.</li><br>
            <li>Amalgamation allowed the use of a single army and police system to maintain law and order.</li><br>
            </ul>
        </li>
       </ol><br><br><br>
       <div class="title" style="background-color: tan;color: black;"><b>PROCESS OF THE AMALGAMATION OF NIGERIAN TERRITORIES</b></div>
       <p>The amalgamation of Nigerian territories was a <b>step-by-step process </b> that began in the 19th century and was completed in 1914 under Lord Frederick Lugard. It involved the gradual bringing together of Lagos, Southern Nigeria, and Northern Nigeria into one political unit.</p>
       <ol>
        <li><b>Annexation of Lagos (1861) </b><br><br>
            <ul>
            <li>Lagos, due to its importance in trade, was annexed by Britain in 1861.</li><br>
            <li>It was made a Crown Colony and placed directly under British rule.</li><br>
            <li>Lagos later became the headquarters for British activities in West Africa.</li><br>
            </ul>
        </li>

        <li><b>Formation of the Southern and Northern Protectorates (1900)</b> <br><br>
            <ul>
            <li>By 1900, Britain had taken control of the Royal Niger Company’s territories.</li><br>
            <li>The territories were divided into two:</li><br>
            <ul>
                <li>Protectorate of Northern Nigeria</li><br>
                <li>Protectorate of Southern Nigeria</li><br>
            </ul>
            <li>This was the beginning of formal British rule across Nigerian lands.</li><br>
            </ul>
        </li>

        <li><b>Merger of Lagos with Southern Nigeria (1906)</b> <br><br>
            <ul>
            <li>The Colony of Lagos was merged with the Southern Protectorate in 1906.</li><br>
            <li>This created the Colony and Protectorate of Southern Nigeria.</li><br>
            <li>This merger reduced administrative costs and made the South more unified.</li><br>
            </ul>
        </li>

        <li><b>The Final Amalgamation (1914) </b><br><br>
            <ul>
            <li>In 1914, the Northern Protectorate was merged with the Colony and Protectorate of Southern Nigeria.</li><br>
            <li>This created one single political entity called Nigeria.</li><br>
            <li>Lord Frederick Lugard became the first Governor-General of the new Nigeria.</li><br>
            <li>Though united under one government, the North and South still maintained some separate administrations (especially in finance and laws).</li><br>
            </ul>
        </li>

        
        </ol><br>
        <div class="title" style="background-color: darkkhaki;color: black;"><b>Key Features of the Amalgamation Process</b></div>
        <ol>
            <li>It was done gradually between 1861 and 1914.</li><br>
            <li>It was initiated for economic and administrative reasons.</li><br>
            <li>Nigerians were not consulted, as the decision was made solely by the British.</li><br>
            <li>It marked the beginning of modern Nigeria, though with future challenges of unity.</li> <br>
        </ol><br><br><br>
        <div class="title" style="background-color: tan; color: black;"><b>KEY PERSONALITIES AND THEIR ROLES IN THE AMALGAMATION OF NIGERIAN TERRITORIES</b></div>
        <p>The <b>Amalgamation of 1914  </b>was not a sudden event. It was the result of years of activities carried out by individuals and groups who prepared the way for British domination and eventual unification of Nigeria. The most important personalities include <b> Sir George Taubman Goldie, Lord Frederick Lugard, European Missionaries, and Nigerian Traditional Rulers. </b></p>
        <ol>
        <li><b>Sir George Taubman Goldie</b> <br><br>
            <ul>
            <li>A British businessman and founder of the Royal Niger Company (RNC).</li> <br>
            <li>He signed treaties of protection with many Nigerian chiefs along the River Niger and Benue, giving Britain legal rights over those territories.</li><br>
            <li>By eliminating competition from other European traders (especially the French and Germans), he secured the Niger area exclusively for Britain.</li><br>
            <li>His activities laid the economic and political foundation for British colonization and later amalgamation.</li><br>
            </ul>
        </li>

        <li><b>Lord Frederick Lugard </b><br><br>
            <ul>
            <li>A British colonial administrator who became the first Governor-General of Nigeria in 1914.</li><br>
            <li>He was the one who formally carried out the amalgamation of the Northern and Southern Protectorates with Lagos.</li><br>
            <li>Lugard introduced the system of Indirect Rule, using traditional rulers to govern on behalf of the British.</li><br>
            <li>He reorganized administration, communication, and finance to make Nigeria a single political unit.</li><br>
            <li>His role was central because he gave Nigeria its modern political identity as one country.</li><br>
            </ul>
        </li>

        <li><b>European Missionaries</b> <br><br>
            <ul>
            <li>Missionary groups such as the Church Missionary Society (CMS), the Roman Catholic Mission, and the Methodist Mission were active in Nigeria.</li><br>
            <li>They established schools, churches, and hospitals, spreading Western education and Christianity.</li><br>
            <li>The educated elite produced by missionary schools later became important voices in Nigerian politics.</li><br>
            <li>By introducing Western ideas of unity, law, and governance, missionaries indirectly supported the British colonial agenda and made amalgamation easier.</li><br>
            </ul>
        </li>

        <li><b>Nigerian Traditional Rulers </b> <br><br>
            <ul>
            <li>Traditional rulers played a major role in the success of British expansion.</li><br>
            <li>Many rulers signed treaties of protection with the British, allowing them access to land and trade.</li><br>
            <li>Some resisted (e.g., Oba Ovonramwen of Benin), but were defeated and their kingdoms brought under British control.</li><br>
            <li>After conquest, traditional rulers became instruments of the Indirect Rule system, helping the British govern vast areas with minimal cost.</li><br>
            <li>Their cooperation was crucial in maintaining peace and order after amalgamation.</li><br>
            </ul>
        </li>
        </ol><br><br><br>
        

        <div class="title" style="background-color: seagreen;color: white;"><b>Effects of the Amalgamation</b></div>

        <h3>Positive Effects</h3>
            <ol>
            <li>Nigeria became recognized as one country.</li><br>
            <li>It laid the foundation for nationalism and eventual independence.</li><br>
            <li>Unified railway, road, and communication systems improved trade and administration.</li><br>
            <li>It created a larger and more important colony for Britain.</li><br>
        </ol>

        <h3>Negative Effects</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>It was done without consulting Nigerians, so there was no sense of unity among the people.</li><br>
            <li>Regional differences (North vs. South) were maintained, leading to future political problems.</li><br>
            <li>It was designed mainly for the economic benefit of Britain, not for Nigerians.</li><br>
            <li>Many Nigerians resisted the policies of taxation and foreign rule after amalgamation.</li>
        </ol><br><br><br>
        <div class="t2"><b>Conclusion</b></div>
        <p>The Amalgamation of Nigeria in 1914 was a major turning point in Nigerian history, creating the foundation of the modern Nigerian state. While it united the Northern and Southern Protectorates and Lagos under a single administration, it was primarily done for British economic, administrative, and political interests, not for the benefit of Nigerians. The use of Indirect Rule allowed Britain to govern efficiently, but regional differences and the lack of consultation with Nigerians created challenges for national unity.</p>
        <p>Overall, the amalgamation laid the groundwork for modern Nigeria, both politically and administratively, while also planting seeds for future regional and ethnic tensions.</p>
