        <ul>
            <li><b>Evolution</b> means the gradual development of something over time.</li><br>
            <li>The <b>evolution of the Nigerian state</b> refers to the historical processes through which the different peoples, kingdoms, and territories in the area now called Nigeria came together under one administration.</li><br>
            <li>This process involved: treaties, conquest, colonization, amalgamation, and eventually independence. </li>

        <div class="title" style="background-color: seagreen;color: white;"><b>THE BERLIN TREATY (1884–1885)</b></div>
        <div class="t2"><b>Background</b></div>
        <ul>
            <li>By the late 19th century, European countries were competing fiercely for colonies in Africa. </li><br>
            <li>This struggle is known as the <b>Scramble for Africa.</b></li><br>
            <li>To avoid conflict among themselves, European powers met in Berlin, Germany, between <b> November 1884 and February 1885.</b></li><br>
            <li>The meeting is called the <b> Berlin Conference,  </b>and the agreement reached is known as the <b>Berlin Treaty.</b></li><br>
            <li>It was hosted by <b> Otto von Bismarck,  </b>the German Chancellor.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="title" style="background-color: darkkhaki;color: black;"><b>Major Reasons for the Berlin Treaty</b></h3>
        <ol>
            <li><b>To settle disputes</b> among European nations over African territories.</li><br>
            <li><b>To regulate the scramble for Africa</b> and prevent wars in Europe.</li><br>
            <li><b>To organize trade and navigation </b> on the Niger and Congo rivers.</li><br>
            <li><b>To stop the slave trade </b> and encourage legitimate trade.</li><br>
            <li>To give <b>international recognition </b> to European claims in Africa.</li><br>
        </ol>

        <h3 class="title" style="background-color: darkkhaki;color: black;"><b>Major Features (Provisions) of the Berlin Treaty</b></h3>
        <ol>
            <li>A European power could not just claim territory in Africa; it had to show <b>effective occupation</b> (actual control of the land and people).</li><br>
            <li><b>Free navigation</b> of the <b>River Niger</b> and the <b>Congo River</b> was guaranteed for all nations.</li><br>
            <li>The <b>Congo Free State</b> was recognized as the private property of King Leopold II of Belgium.</li><br>
            <li>The treaty <b>condemned the slave trade </b>and encouraged Christian missionary work and “civilizing” activities.</li><br>
            <li>Every European nation must <b>notify others</b> before claiming any part of Africa.</li><br>
        </ol>

        <h3 class="title" style="background-color: darkkhaki;color: black;"><b>Effects of the Berlin Treaty on Africa and Nigeria</b></h3>
        <ol>
            <li>It officially divided Africa into spheres of influence among European powers.</li><br>
            <li>African leaders and peoples were <b>not consulted;</b> their lands were shared without their consent.</li><br>
            <li>It increased <b>European rivalry </b> in Africa, leading to military conquest of African societies.</li><br>
            <li>It gave Britain the <b>legal right</b> to control territories along the River Niger, which later became Nigeria.</li><br>
            <li>It marked the <b>beginning of formal colonialism </b> in Africa.</li>
        </ol><br><br><br><br>
        <div class="title" style="background-color: sienna;color: white;"><b>THE ROYAL NIGER COMPANY AND ITS ROLE IN NIGERIAN TERRITORIES</b></div>
        <div class="t2"><b>Background</b></div>
        <ul>
            <li> During the 19th century, Europeans were competing for trade and territories in West Africa.</li><br>
            <li>In Nigeria, one major company became very influential: the Royal Niger Company (RNC).</li><br>
            <li>It was originally formed as the United African Company by Sir George Taubman Goldie in 1879.</li><br>
            <li>In 1886, the British government granted it a charter, giving it both commercial and political powers in the Niger area.</li><br>
            <li>Its headquarters was in Lokoja, at the confluence of the Niger and Benue rivers. </li>
        </ul><br>
        <div class="title" style="background-color: tan;color: black;"><b>Powers of the Royal Niger Company</b></div>
        <ol>
            <li>The charter gave it authority to make treaties with African rulers. </li><br>
            <li>It could administer justice, collect taxes, and maintain law and order.</li><br>
            <li>It was allowed to build forts and stations along the rivers.</li><br>
            <li>It had the right to trade and control commerce in its territories.</li><br>
        </ol>
        <div class="title" style="background-color: tan;color: black;"><b>Roles of the Royal Niger Company in Nigerian Territories</b></div>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Signing Treaties</b> <br><br>
                <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
                <li>The company signed numerous treaties of protection with local chiefs and rulers.</li><br>
                <li>These treaties gave Britain legal rights over Nigerian territories.</li><br>
                <li>For example, it signed treaties with chiefs in the Niger Delta and Middle Belt areas.</li><br>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li><b>Establishing Trade Monopoly</b> <br><br>
                <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
                <li>The company created a monopoly of trade along the Niger and Benue rivers.</li><br>
                <li>African traders and other European merchants found it difficult to compete.</li><br>
                <li>It encouraged the trade in palm oil, kernels, and other raw materials instead of slave trade.</li><br>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li><b>Political and Administrative Control</b> <br><br>
                <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
                <li>The RNC acted as a government in many areas under its control.</li><br>
                <li>It built administrative posts, appointed agents, and settled disputes.</li><br>
                <li>It maintained private police and military forces to protect its interests.</li><br>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li><b>Expansion of British Influence</b> <br><br>
                <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
                <li>By controlling trade and treaties, the company paved the way for British colonization.</li><br>
                <li>It resisted competition from French and German traders, thereby securing the area for Britain.</li><br>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li><b>Handing Over to the British Government</b> <br><br>
                <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
                <li>By the end of the 19th century, administering the territories became too expensive for the company.</li><br>
                <li>In 1900, the British government revoked its charter and took over direct control.</li><br>
                <li>The company was paid £865,000 as compensation.</li><br>
                <li>This marked the beginning of official colonial rule in Nigeria.</li><br>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol><br>
        <div class="title" style="background-color: tan; color: black;"><b>Importance of the Royal Niger Company</b></div>
         <ul>
            <li>It laid the foundation for British rule in Nigeria.</li><br>
            <li>It helped to stop foreign (especially French and German) expansion in the Niger area.</li><br>
            <li>It developed trade and communication along the rivers.</li><br>
            <li>It was a link between the period of free trade and full British colonial administration.</li><br>
        </ul><br><br><br>
        <div class="title" style="background-color: darkcyan;color: white;"><b>COLONIAL CONQUEST AND ADMINISTRATION OF NIGERIAN TERRITORIES</b></div>
        <div class="t2"><b>Background</b></div>
        <ul>
            <li>After the <b>Berlin Conference (1884–1885),</b> European powers rushed to establish control over African territories. </li><br>
            <li>Britain was given the Niger area, but to make this effective, it had to conquer local states and set up administration.</li><br>
            <li>The period of conquest in Nigeria stretched from the late <b> 19th century to the early 20th century, </b> after which Britain formally controlled the whole territory.</li>
        </ul><br>
        <div class="title" style="background-color: rosybrown;color: black;"><b>Colonial Conquest of Nigerian Territories</b></div>
       <div class="t2"><b>Methods of Conquest</b></div>
      
        <p>Britain used several strategies to bring Nigerian peoples under control:</p>
       <ol>
        <li>Treaties of protection with traditional rulers (e.g., with chiefs in the Niger Delta).</li><br>
        <li>Military force against states that resisted (e.g., Benin, Arochukwu, Sokoto).</li><br>
        <li>Diplomacy and alliances with rival local groups.</li><br>
        <li>Divide-and-rule tactics, exploiting internal disputes among Nigerian peoples.</li><br>
      </ol>

        <div class="t2"><b>Examples of Major Conquests</b></div>
        <ul>
        <li><b>Benin Kingdom (1897):</b>
        Benin resisted British influence. After the killing of some British officials, the British launched a “punitive expedition” in 1897, destroying Benin City and exiling Oba Ovonramwen.</li><br>

        <li><b>Arochukwu (1902):</b>
        The Aro people controlled a powerful trade and religious network in Eastern Nigeria. The British attacked and conquered them in 1902, ending their influence.</li><br>

        <li><b>Sokoto Caliphate (1903):</b>
        Lord Lugard led British forces against the Fulani emirates. Sokoto and Kano fell in 1903, bringing the Caliphate under British control.</li><br>

        <li><b>Other Areas:</b>
        Nupe, Tiv, and other Middle Belt peoples were subdued through military campaigns.</li><br>
        </ul>

        <p>By 1906, almost all Nigerian territories were under British rule.</p><br><br><br>
        <div class="title" style="background-color: rosybrown;color: black;"><b>Colonial Administration of Nigerian Territories</b></div>
        <h3>1. Early Administration</h3>
        
        <ul>
            <li><p>In 1900, Britain officially took over from the Royal Niger Company.</p></li>
            <li><p>Nigeria was divided into:</p> </li>
          <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
           <li>Protectorate of Northern Nigeria</li><br>
            <li>Protectorate of Southern Nigeria</li><br>
            <li>Colony of Lagos</li>
          </ul>
        </ul>
        

        <h3>2. The Amalgamation of 1914</h3>
        <p>In 1914, Lord Frederick Lugard merged the North and South with Lagos to form one political entity called Nigeria.</p>
        <p>This made Nigeria easier to govern as a single colony.</p>

        <h3>3. System of Administration</h3>
        <p>The British introduced the Indirect Rule system, especially in the north, where local rulers governed under British supervision.</p>
        <p>In the south, where centralized systems were weaker, indirect rule was less successful.</p>

         <div class="title" style="background-color: rosybrown;color: black;"><b>Features of Colonial Administration</b></div>
        <ol>
            <li>Nigeria was ruled by a Governor-General (e.g., Lord Lugard).</li><br>
            <li>The colonial government was responsible to the British Crown.</li><br>
            <li>The economy was based on producing raw materials (palm oil, cocoa, groundnuts, cotton) for export to Britain.</li><br>
            <li>The colonial army and police maintained law and order.</li><br>
            <li>Courts, taxation, and communication systems (railways, telegraphs, roads) were established.</li><br>
        </ol>

        <div class="title" style="background-color: rosybrown;color: black;"><b>Effects of Colonial Conquest and Administration</b></div>

        <h4>Positive Effects</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Construction of railways, roads, and ports.</li><br>
            <li>Introduction of Western education and new political ideas.</li><br>
            <li>Spread of Christianity and Western culture.</li><br>
            <li>Unification of different peoples into one country called Nigeria.</li><br>
        </ol>

        <h4>Negative Effects</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Loss of political independence and sovereignty.</li><br>
            <li>Exploitation of resources for the benefit of Britain.</li><br>
            <li>Harsh taxation and forced labor.</li>
            <li>Cultural disruption and erosion of traditional authority.</li><br>
