        <p>The <b>Independence Movement in Nigeria</b> refers to the political, social, and economic efforts made by Nigerians to gain self-rule and end British colonial domination. This movement gained momentum after World War II and led to Nigeria becoming an independent nation on <b> 1st October 1960. </b></p>
       <br><br>
       <div class="t2"><b>Background</b></div>

        <li>British policies often favored economic <b> exploitation and political control </b> with little regard for Nigerian welfare.</li><br>
        <li>Educated Nigerians, returning ex-servicemen, and traditional leaders began to demand <b> political representation, equality, and self-governance.</b></li><br>
        <li>The experiences of <b>World War I and II </b> exposed Nigerians to <b> ideas of freedom, democracy, and nationalism. </b></li>
       </ul><br><br><br>
       <div class="title" style="background-color: darkcyan;color: white;"><b>NIGERIAN NATIONALISM AND THE STRUGGLE FOR INDEPENDENCE</b></div>
       <div class="t2"><b>Meaning of Nationalism</b></div>
       <ul>
        <li><b>Nationalism</b> is the <b>love for one’s country  </b>and the desire for self-rule, political independence, and sovereignty. </li>
        <li>In Nigeria, nationalism refers to the efforts of Nigerians to <b>unite, protect their interests, and end British colonial rule.</b></li>
       </ul>
       <br><br><br>
       <div class="title" style="background-color: seagreen;color: white;"><b>Factors that Contributed to Nigerian Nationalism</b></div>
       <ol>
        <li><b>Economic Exploitation</b> <br><br>
            <ul>
            <li>Nigeria’s resources (palm oil, cocoa, groundnuts, and minerals) were used to benefit Britain.</li><br>
            <li>Nigerians wanted control over their own resources.</li><br>
            </ul>
        </li>

        <li><b>Political Exclusion </b> <br><br>
            <ul>
            <li>Nigerians had limited say in governance and were mostly excluded from decision-making.</li><br>
            <li>Only a few elite Nigerians were allowed to participate in local councils.</li><br>
            </ul>
        </li>

        <li><b>Influence of Education </b> <br><br>
            <ul>
            <li>Western education produced a new elite of professionals who understood political ideas like democracy and self-rule.</li> <br>
            </ul>
        </li>

        <li><b>Impact of World Wars</b> <br><br>
            <ul>
            <li>Many Nigerians fought in the World Wars and returned with nationalist ideas and determination for self-rule.</li><br>
            </ul>
        </li>

        <li><b>Influence of Nationalism Worldwide</b> <br><br>
            <ul>
            <li>Decolonization movements in Asia and Africa inspired Nigerians to demand independence.</li><br>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><b>Labour Movements and Social Activism</b> <br><br>
            <ul>
            <li>Trade unions and workers’ strikes exposed social inequalities and helped raise nationalist sentiment.</li><br>

        </ol><br><br><br>
        <div class="title" style="background-color: darkolivegreen;color: white;"><b>The Nature of Nigerian Nationalism</b></div>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Regional:</strong> Early nationalism often focused on ethnic or regional interests, e.g., the North, South, or Lagos.</li><br>
            <li><strong>Political:</strong> Formation of political parties to represent local and national interests, e.g., NCNC, AG, NPC.</li><br>
            <li><strong>Peaceful and Negotiated:</strong> Many nationalist efforts relied on constitutional demands, petitions, and dialogue rather than violence.</li><br>
            <li><strong>Mass Mobilization:</strong> Newspapers, rallies, and public meetings helped educate and unite Nigerians around the idea of independence.</li><br>
            <li><strong>Educated Leadership:</strong> The movement was largely driven by Western-educated elites who used ideas of democracy, justice, and self-rule.</li>
        </ol><br><br><br>
