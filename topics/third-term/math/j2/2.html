        <h2>Meaning of Bearing</h2>
        <p><b>Bearing</b> is a way of finding or showing direction. It tells us where one place is from another place by using angles.</p>
        <p>When we want to move from one place to another, we must know the direction. Bearing helps us to describe that direction exactly by measuring an angle from the North line.</p>
        <p><strong>In simple words:</strong> Bearing means “the angle measured clockwise from the North direction to the line that joins two places.”</p>
        <p>For example, if you are standing at point A and you want to go to point B, you draw a line pointing North at point A. Then you measure the angle clockwise (like the hand of a clock) until you reach the line joining A and B. That angle is called the bearing of B from A.</p>

        <h2>Important Facts About Bearing</h2>
        <p>All bearings are measured from the North direction. We always start counting the angle from the North line.</p>
        <p>Bearings are measured clockwise. Clockwise means in the same direction that the hands of a clock move.</p>
        <p>Bearings are written in three figures (three digits). This helps us to write them neatly and clearly.</p>
        <p>For example:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>5° is written as 005°</li><br>
        <li>35° is written as 035°</li><br>
        <li>90° is written as 090°</li><br>
        </ul>
        <p>Bearings are always between 000° and 360°.</p>
        <p>000° or 360° means North</p>
        <p>090° means East</p>
        <p>180° means South</p>
        <p>270° means West</p>
        <p>So, a full circle has 360°, and that circle shows all the possible bearings.</p><br><br>

        <h2>   MAJOR AND MINOR CARDINAL POINTS</h2>

        <h3>Meaning of Cardinal Points</h3>
        <p>Cardinal points are the main directions that show how to locate one place from another. They are shown on a compass.</p>
        <p>A compass is an instrument used for finding directions. It has a needle that always points to the North.</p>

        <h3>The Four Major Cardinal Points</h3>
        <p>There are four major cardinal points:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>North (N)</li><br>
        <li>East (E)</li><br>
        <li>South (S)</li><br>
        <li>West (W)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These four points divide the compass into four equal parts, and each part is 90° apart.</p>
        <p>Bearings of the Major Cardinal Points:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>North → 000° or 360°</li><br>
        <li>East → 090°</li><br>
        <li>South → 180°</li><br>
        <li>West → 270°</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>The Four Minor (Intermediate) Cardinal Points</h3>
        <p>Between each pair of major points, there is a middle direction called a minor or intermediate cardinal point.</p>
        <p>The four minor cardinal points are:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Northeast (NE) – between North and East</li><br>
        <li>Southeast (SE) – between South and East</li><br>
        <li>Southwest (SW) – between South and West</li><br>
        <li>Northwest (NW) – between North and West</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Now we have eight main directions on a compass.</p>
        <p>Bearings of the Minor Points:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>NE → 045°</li><br>
        <li>SE → 135°</li><br>
        <li>SW → 225°</li><br>
        <li>NW → 315°</li>
        </ul>

        <ol>
        <li>They help us to know and describe directions.</li><br>
        <li>They are used in maps and navigation.</li><br>
        <li>They help pilots, sailors, and travelers to move in the right direction.</li><br>

        </ol>

        <h3>Relationship Between Cardinal Points and Bearing</h3>
        <p>Cardinal points and bearings are closely connected. Each direction on the compass has a bearing value.</p>

        </tr>
        </table>
        <p>So, cardinal points show general directions, while bearings show exact angles between places.</p>

        <h2>Types of Bearing</h2>
        <p>There are two main types of bearings that we learn in JSS Mathematics:</p>

        <h3>1. Compass Bearing (or Ordinary Bearing)</h3>
        <p>Compass bearing uses the letters N, S, E, and W to show direction. The angle is always less than 90°. We start from North or South, then turn East or West.</p>
        <table border="1">
        <tr>
        <th>Compass Bearing</th>
        <th>How to Read It</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
        <td>N 40° E</td>
        <td>From North, turn 40° toward East</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
        <td>N 25° W</td>
        <td>From North, turn 25° toward West</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
        <td>S 30° E</td>
        <td>From South, turn 30° toward East</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
        <td>S 45° W</td>
        <td>From South, turn 45° toward West</td>
        </tr>
        </table>
        <p>If a point B is N 40° E from point A, start at A, look North, then turn 40° toward East. That is where B is located.</p>

        <h3>2. Three-Figure Bearing</h3>
        <p>Three-figure bearing uses only numbers (no N, S, E, or W). We measure the angle clockwise from the North direction and write it in three digits.</p>
        <table border="1">
        <tr>
        <th>Direction</th>
        <th>Bearing</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
        <td>North</td>
        <td>000° or 360°</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
        <td>East</td>
        <td>090°</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
        <td>South</td>
        <td>180°</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
        <td>West</td>
        <td>270°</td>
        </tr>
        </table>

        </table>

        <h3>Bearing of A from B and Bearing of B from A</h3>
        <p>“Bearing of B from A” means you are standing at A and looking toward B.</p>
        <p>“Bearing of A from B” means you are standing at B and looking toward A. They are not the same. They are in opposite directions.</p>
        <p>To find the opposite bearing:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>If the bearing is less than 180°, add 180°.</li>
        <li>If the bearing is more than 180°, subtract 180°.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Examples:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Bearing of B from A = 065° → Bearing of A from B = 065° + 180° = 245°</li><br>
        <li>Bearing of B from A = 300° → Bearing of A from B = 300° − 180° = 120°</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>How to Find Bearing from a Map or Diagram</h3>
        <ol>
        <li>Mark the two points (example: A and B).</li><br>
        <li>Draw a line pointing straight North from the starting point.</li><br>
        <li>Draw a line from that point to the other point.</li><br>
        <li>Measure the angle clockwise from the North line to the line joining the two points.</li><br>
        <li>Write your answer in three figures.</li>
        </ol>

        

        <h3>Uses of Bearings</h3>
        <ol>
        <li>Used by pilots and sailors to find directions while traveling.</li><br>
        <li>Used in surveying to measure land and mark boundaries.</li><br>
        <li>Used in map reading to locate towns and landmarks.</li><br>
        <li>Used in engineering and construction to draw plans.</li><br>
        <li>Used in geography to describe where one place is located from another.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Common Mistakes Students Make</h3>
        <ul>
        <li>Measuring the angle anticlockwise instead of clockwise.</li><br>
        <li>Forgetting to start from the North line.</li><br>
        <li>Writing bearings in two digits instead of three (e.g., 40° instead of 040°).</li><br>
        <li>Mixing up “bearing of A from B” and “bearing of B from A.”</li><br>
        <li>Using the wrong formula when converting compass bearings.</li>
        </ul><br><br>
