        <h3>Meaning of Probability</h3>
        <p>Probability is the branch of mathematics that deals with the study of chance and uncertainty.<br>
        It tells us how likely an event is to occur.</p>
        <p>We use probability to describe situations where we are not certain about the outcome — for example:</p>
        <ol>
        <li>Will it rain tomorrow?</li><br>
        <li>Will our school team win the next match?</li><br>
        <li>If I pick a card, what are the chances it will be red?</li><br>
        </ol>
        <p>In short, probability measures how likely or unlikely something is to happen.</p>

        <br><br>
        <div class="title" style="background-color: #0b5a3a;color: white;"><b>Examples of Probability in Everyday Life</b></div>
        <ol>
        <li>Predicting if it will rain or not.</li><br>
        <li>Tossing a coin and expecting heads or tails.</li><br>
        <li>Drawing a card from a pack.</li><br>
        <li>Selecting a student at random to answer a question.</li><br>
        <li>Checking the chance that a bus will arrive late.</li><br>
        <li>Expecting your name to be chosen in a school raffle draw.</li><br>
        <li>Guessing whether a baby will be a boy or girl.</li><br>
        <li>Choosing a colour of ball from a bag without looking.</li><br>
        <li>Estimating the chance of passing an exam based on past results.</li><br>
        <li>Predicting which football team will win a match.</li><br>
        </ol><br><br>

        <div class="title" style="background-color: darkkhaki;color: black;"><b>Important Terms in Probability</b></div>
        <ol>
        <li><strong>Experiment</strong> — Any activity or process that can be repeated and has two or more possible outcomes.<br>
        Example: Tossing a coin or drawing a card.</li><br>

        <li><strong>Outcome</strong> — The result of an experiment.<br>
        Example: Getting “head” when a coin is tossed.</li><br>

        <li><strong>Sample Space</strong> — The set of all possible outcomes of an experiment.<br>
        Example: When tossing a coin → {Head, Tail}.</li><br>

        <li><strong>Event</strong> — One or more outcomes of interest from an experiment.<br>
        Example: Getting an even number when a die is rolled.</li><br>

        <li><strong>Favourable Outcomes</strong> — The outcomes we are looking for.<br>
        Example: Getting a 4 when rolling a die — only one favourable outcome.</li><br>

        <li><strong>Trial</strong> — Each performance or repetition of an experiment.<br>
        Example: Tossing a coin once is one trial.</li><br>

        <li><strong>Impossible Event</strong> — An event that cannot happen.<br>
        Example: Getting a number greater than 6 on a die.</li><br>

        <li><strong>Certain Event</strong> — An event that must happen.<br>
        Example: Getting a number less than 7 when rolling a die (since all numbers 1–6 are less than 7).</li><br>

        <li><strong>Equally Likely Events</strong> — Events that have the same chance of occurring.<br>
        Example: When tossing a fair coin, getting heads or tails are equally likely.</li><br>
        </ol>

        <h3>Formula for Probability</h3>
        <p>The probability of an event is given by:</p>
        <p><strong>P(E) = Number of favourable outcomes / Total number of possible outcomes</strong></p>

        <p>Where:</p>
        <ol>
        <li>P(E) = probability of the event E occurring.</li><br>
        <li>The result is always between 0 and 1.</li><br>
        </ol>

        <h3>Probability Scale</h3>
        <table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5">
        <tr>
            <th>Event Type</th>
            <th>Meaning</th>
            <th>Probability</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Impossible</td>
            <td>Cannot happen</td>
            <td>0</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Unlikely</td>
            <td>May not happen</td>
            <td>Between 0 and 0.5</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Even Chance</td>
            <td>Can happen or not happen</td>
            <td>0.5</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Likely</td>
            <td>Expected to happen</td>
            <td>Between 0.5 and 1</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Certain</td>
            <td>Must happen</td>
            <td>1</td>
        </tr>
        </table>

        <p><strong>0</strong> means the event will never happen.<br>
        <strong>1</strong> means the event will definitely happen.<br>
        Values between 0 and 1 show how likely it is.</p><br><br>

        <div class="title" style="background-color: sienna;color: white;"><b>Types of Probability</b></div>
        <ol>
        <li><strong>Theoretical Probability</strong><br><br>
        – Found using reasoning or calculation, without actual experiment.<br><br>
        – Based on what should happen in theory.<br><br>
        – Example: The probability of getting a head when tossing a fair coin is ½.</li><br>

        <li><strong>Experimental Probability</strong><br><br>
        – Found by carrying out an actual experiment or observation.<br><br>
        – Based on what really happens when the experiment is performed.<br><br>
        – Formula:<br>
        <strong>Experimental Probability = Number of times event occurs / Total number of trials</strong></li><br>
        </ol><br><br>


        <div class="title" style="background-color: darkcyan;color: white;"><b>Properties of Probability</b></div>
        <ol>
        <li>The probability of any event lies between 0 and 1. (That is, 0 ≤ P(E) ≤ 1).</li><br>
        <li>The sum of probabilities of all possible outcomes is 1.</li><br>
        <li>The probability of an event not happening is given by: <strong>P(not E) = 1 − P(E)</strong></li><br>
        <li>If an event is certain, P(E) = 1.</li><br>
        <li>If an event is impossible, P(E) = 0.</li><br>
        </ol><br><br>

        <div class="title" style="background-color: seagreen;color: white;"><b>Uses and Importance of Probability</b></div>
        <ol>
        <li>It helps us to make better predictions and decisions.</li><br>
        <li>It helps in planning — like estimating risks and chances of success.</li><br>
        <li>It helps in games and sports for predicting possible outcomes.</li><br>
        <li>It is used in business and insurance to calculate risks and profits.</li><br>
        <li>It helps in weather forecasting.</li><br>
        <li>It is used in medicine for predicting success of treatment.</li><br>
        <li>It helps in education — teachers can estimate the chance of students passing exams.</li><br>
        <li>It helps in transportation planning — e.g., predicting bus delays.</li><br>
        </ol><br><br>

        <div class="title" style="background-color: darkolivegreen;color: white;"><b>Advantages of Understanding Probability</b></div>
        <ol>
        <li>Makes decision-making easier and more logical.</li><br>
        <li>Helps to estimate possible risks and benefits.</li><br>
        <li>Useful in everyday life situations.</li><br>
        <li>Helps in reasoning and problem-solving.</li><br>
        </ol><br><br>

        <div class="title" style="background-color: rosybrown;color: black;"><b>Disadvantages or Limitations of Probability</b></div>
        <ol>
        <li>Results are not always certain, only likely.</li><br>
        <li>It depends on the accuracy of information or experiment.</li><br>
        <li>Incomplete or biased data can lead to wrong results.</li><br>
        <li>Some real-life events are too complex to calculate exactly.</li><br>

        <p><b>Problem:</b> A box has 3 mangoes, 4 oranges, 3 apples (total 10 fruits). You pick 2 fruits one after the other without replacement. What is the probability both picked are apples?</p>
        <p><b>Steps:</b><br>
        Total fruits = 10. Favourable first pick (apple) = 3.<br>
        P(first apple) = 3 ÷ 10.<br>
        After one apple is taken, apples left = 2, total left = 9.<br>
        P(second apple | first apple) = 2 ÷ 9.<br>
        Multiply: P(both apples) = (3/10) × (2/9) = 6 ÷ 90 = 1 ÷ 15 = 1/15 ≈ 6.67%.<br>
        <b>Answer:</b> 1/15 (≈6.67%).</p>

        <h3>11) School Survey (Union of Events)</h3>
        <p><b>Problem:</b> At a club fair, 30 students like football, 20 like basketball, and 10 like both sports. If a student is chosen at random from the group, what is the probability they like football or basketball?</p>
        <p><b>Steps:</b><br>
        P(Football or Basketball) = P(F) + P(B) − P(F and B)<br>
        Total unique students = 30 + 20 − 10 = 40.<br>
        P(F) = 30 ÷ 40 = 3/4.<br>
        P(B) = 20 ÷ 40 = 1/2.<br>
        P(F and B) = 10 ÷ 40 = 1/4.<br>
        P(F or B) = 3/4 + 1/2 − 1/4 = 1 (100%).<br>
        <b>Answer:</b> 1 (100%).</p>

        <h3>12) School Prize (Conditional Choice)</h3>
        <p><b>Problem:</b> In a class of 30, 18 brought books and 12 did not. The teacher picks one student at random who brought books for a prize. What is the probability the picked student brought books?</p>
        <p><b>Steps:</b><br>
        Total students = 30. Favourable (brought books) = 18.<br>
        Probability = 18 ÷ 30 = divide by 6 → 3 ÷ 5 = 3/5 = 60%.<br>
        <b>Answer:</b> 3/5 (60%).</p>

        <h3>13) Bus Card Top-up (Percent to Probability)</h3>
        <p><b>Problem:</b> A small survey found 60% of commuters use bus card A. If you meet one commuter at random, what is the probability they use bus card A?</p>
        <p><b>Steps:</b><br>
        Percent 60% = 60 ÷ 100 = 0.60.<br>
        As fraction = 60/100 = 3/5.<br>
        Probability = 3/5 (0.6 or 60%).<br>
        <b>Answer:</b> 3/5 (60%).</p>

        <h3>14) School Canteen (At least one)</h3>
        <p><b>Problem:</b> The canteen sells 4 types of drinks; yesterday 40 cartons were sold: 10 cola, 12 malt, 8 juice, 10 water. If you pick one sold carton at random, what is the probability it is not juice?</p>
        <p><b>Steps:</b><br>
        Total = 40. Favourable (not juice) = 40 − 8 = 32.<br>
        Probability = 32 ÷ 40 = divide by 8 → 4 ÷ 5 = 4/5 = 80%.<br>
        <b>Answer:</b> 4/5 (80%).</p>

        <h3>15) Two-stage with Replacement (Marbles)</h3>
        <p><b>Problem:</b> A jar has 6 red and 4 blue marbles. You draw one marble, note the colour, put it back, then draw again. What is the probability both draws are red?</p>
        <p><b>Steps:</b><br>
        Since we replace, probabilities do not change between draws.<br>
        P(red on first) = 6 ÷ 10 = 3/5.<br>
        P(red on second) = 3/5.<br>
        Multiply: (3/5) × (3/5) = 9/25 = 36%.<br>
        <b>Answer:</b> 9/25 (36%).</p>


       

        <h3>16) Tossing a Coin</h3>
        <p>When a coin is tossed:</p>
        <p>Sample space = {Head (H), Tail (T)}<br>
        Total outcomes = 2<br>
        Favourable outcomes for Head = 1</p>
        <pre>
        P(Head) = 1 ÷ 2 = 1/2
        </pre>
        <p>Similarly,</p>
        <pre>
        P(Tail) = 1 ÷ 2 = 1/2

        <h3>17) Rolling a Die</h3>
        <p>When a die is rolled:</p>
        <p>Sample space = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}</p>
        <p>If we want the probability of getting an even number:</p>
        <p>Favourable outcomes = {2, 4, 6} → 3 outcomes</p>
        <pre>
        P(Even number) = 3 ÷ 6 = 1/2
        </pre>

        </ul>
        <p>Solution:</p>
        <p>Total number of balls = 5 + 3 + 2 = 10</p>
        <p>(i) Favourable outcomes for red = 5</p>
        <pre>
        P(Red) = 5 ÷ 10 = 1/2
        </pre>
        <p>(ii) Favourable outcomes for green = 2</p>
        <pre>
        P(Green) = 2 ÷ 10 = 1/5
        </pre>

        <h3>19) Getting a 3 on a Die</h3>
        <p>Sample space = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}<br>
        Favourable outcome = {3}<br>
        Total outcomes = 6</p>
        <pre>
        P(3) = 1 ÷ 6
        </pre>

        <h3>Range of Probability</h3>
        <p>The value of probability is always between 0 and 1.</p>

        <h3>Complementary Events</h3>
        <p>If the probability of an event happening is P(E), then the probability of it not happening is:</p>
        <pre>
        P(not E) = 1 - P(E)
        </pre>
        <p>Example: If P(getting a head) = 1/2, then<br>
        P(not getting a head) = 1 - 1/2 = 1/2</p>

        <h3>20) Word Problem — White and Black Balls</h3>
        <p>A bag contains 4 white balls and 6 black balls. If one ball is picked at random, find:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>(a) The probability of picking a white ball.</li><br>
        <li>(b) The probability of picking a black ball.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Solution:</p>
        <p>Total balls = 4 + 6 = 10</p>
        <p>(a) P(White) = 4/10 = 2/5</p>
        <p>(b) P(Black) = 6/10 = 3/5</p>

        <h3>21) Word Problem — Red, Green, Blue Balls</h3>
        <p>A box contains 2 red, 3 green, and 5 blue balls. If a ball is selected at random, find the probability that it is:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>(a) Red</li><br>
        <li>(b) Not blue</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Solution:</p>
        <p>Total = 2 + 3 + 5 = 10</p>
        <p>(a) P(Red) = 2/10 = 1/5</p>
        <p>(b) Not blue → Red or Green = 2 + 3 = 5<br>
        P(Not blue) = 5/10 = 1/2</p>

        <h3>22) Word Problem — Prime Number or Greater than 4</h3>
        <p>A die is thrown once. Find the probability of getting:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>(a) A prime number</li><br>
        <li>(b) A number greater than 4</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Solution:</p>
        <p>Sample space = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}</p>
        <p>(a) Prime numbers = {2, 3, 5} → 3 outcomes<br><br>
        P(Prime) = 3/6 = 1/2</p>
        <p>(b) Numbers greater than 4 = {5, 6} → 2 outcomes<br><br>
        P(Greater than 4) = 2/6 = 1/3</p>

        <h3>23) Word Problem — Coin Tossed Twice</h3>
        <p>A coin is tossed twice. Find the probability of getting:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>(a) Two heads</li><br>
        <li>(b) One head</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Solution:</p>
        <p>Sample space = {HH, HT, TH, TT} → 4 outcomes</p>
        <p>(a) Two heads = {HH} → 1 outcome<br><br>
        P(Two heads) = 1/4</p>
        <p>(b) One head = {HT, TH} → 2 outcomes<br><br>
        P(One head) = 2/4 = 1/2</p>


        <h3>Quick Tips for Solving Real-Life Probability Problems</h3>
        <ol>
        <li>Count the total possible items (people, days, fruits, tickets).</li><br>
        <li>Count the favourable cases (the outcomes you want).</li><br>
        <li>Divide favourable by total.</li><br>
        <li>Simplify the fraction and, if helpful, convert to percent or decimal.</li><br>
        <li>Use complement (1 − P(E)) when “not” is easier to count.</li><br>
        <li>For sequential draws: if without replacement, reduce the total after each draw; if with replacement, totals stay the same and multiply probabilities.</li><br>
        </ol>


        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <ol>
        <li>Probability measures how likely an event is to occur.</li><br>
        <li>The value of probability is between 0 and 1.</li><br>
        <li>Formula: <strong>P(E) = Number of favourable outcomes / Total number of possible outcomes</strong></li><br>
        <li>Probability helps us to make informed predictions in uncertain situations.</li><br>
