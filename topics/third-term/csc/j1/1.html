            <h3>Meaning of Information Transmission</h3>
            <p>Information transmission means the process by which information is sent or transferred from one person, place, or device (called the sender) to another (called the receiver) through a medium or channel.</p>
            <p>In simple terms, when one person or device sends a message and another receives it, information transmission has occurred.</p>
            <p>For example, when a teacher talks to students, when a radio station sends out news, or when you make a phone call, information is being transmitted.</p>

            <p>This process involves five main elements:</p>
            <ol>
            <li>Sender (Source): The person or device that originates the message.</li><br>
            <li>Message: The actual information that is being sent.</li><br>
            <li>Medium or Channel: The path through which the message travels, such as air, wires, or radio waves.</li><br>
            <li>Receiver: The person or device that receives the message.</li><br>
            <li>Feedback: The response from the receiver showing that the message was understood.</li><br>
            </ol><br><br>

            <div class="title" style="background-color: #0b5a3a;color: white;"><b>Purpose of Information Transmission</b></div>
            <ol>
            <li>It helps us to share knowledge and ideas with one another.</li><br>
            <li>It helps us to educate, inform, and entertain others.</li><br>
            <li>It helps us to warn people of danger.</li><br>
            <li>It helps us to build relationships and maintain communication between people.</li><br>
            <li>It helps us to make quick and accurate decisions.</li><br>
            </ol>

            <h3>Means of Information Transmission</h3>
            <p>The means of information transmission are the tools or methods that people use to send information. There are two main means:</p>
            <ol>
            <li>Ancient (Traditional) Means — used in the olden days before the invention of electronic devices.</li><br>
            <li>Modern (Electronic) Means — used today with the help of electricity and technology.</li><br>
            </ol>

        </section>

        <section>
            <div class="title" style="background-color: darkcyan;color: white;"><b>Ancient (Traditional) Methods of Information Transmission</b></div>
            <p>Ancient methods of transmitting information are the ways people used to communicate before electricity and modern devices were discovered. These methods depended mainly on the human senses (sight, hearing, and speech) and natural materials.</p>

            <h3>1. Oral Communication</h3>
            <p>Oral communication means using spoken words to send messages from one person to another. It is the oldest and most natural form of communication.</p>
            <p>Examples: A mother instructing her child, a teacher speaking to students, or a town crier making announcements.</p>

            <p><strong>Advantages of Oral Communication:</strong></p>
            <ol>
            <li>It is the simplest and easiest way to communicate.</li><br>
            <li>It allows quick feedback and immediate understanding.</li><br>
            <li>It does not require any special equipment.</li><br>
            <li>It helps to build a personal relationship between the sender and receiver.</li><br>
            <li>It allows the sender to adjust speech or tone for better understanding.</li><br>
            <li>It is useful in informal situations and for small groups.</li><br>
            <li>It saves time because the message is delivered instantly.</li><br>
            </ol>

            <p><strong>Disadvantages of Oral Communication:</strong></p>
            <ol>
            <li>It cannot reach far distances unless the people are close.</li><br>
            <li>The message can easily be forgotten or distorted.</li><br>
            <li>It cannot be recorded permanently.</li><br>
            <li>It depends on the ability of both parties to speak and hear clearly.</li><br>
            <li>Noise can disturb and change the meaning of the message.</li><br>
            <li>It is not suitable for complex or long messages.</li><br>
            <li>It is difficult to prove what was said later.</li><br>
            </ol>

            <h3>2. Beating of Drums</h3>
            <p>In many African societies, drums were used to pass messages from one village to another. Each drumbeat had a specific meaning that people in the community understood.</p>
            <p>Examples: Calling people for meetings, announcing funerals, warning of enemies, or celebrating events.</p>

            <p><strong>Advantages of Beating of Drums:</strong></p>

            <li>The message may be misunderstood by strangers.</li><br>
            <li>It cannot convey complex information.</li><br>
            <li>It can be affected by weather such as rain or wind.</li><br>
            <li>It cannot be used secretly because everyone can hear it.</li><br>
            <li>It may disturb people at odd hours.</li><br>
            <li>It requires physical energy to beat for long.</li><br>
            </ol>

            <h3>3. Fire Lighting and Smoke Signalling</h3>
            <p>This method involves lighting fire or producing smoke to send messages to people far away. The message is understood by the pattern, color, or number of smoke signals.</p>

            <h2> Classifying Information by Mode of Transmission</h2>

            <h3>A. By the Mode (How it is received by the senses)</h3>
            <ol>
            <li>Audio Transmission — Received by hearing such as radio and oral communication.</li><br>
            <li>Visual Transmission — Received by sight such as drawings, newspapers, and posters.</li><br>
            <li>Audio-Visual Transmission — Received by both hearing and sight such as television and video call.</li><br>
            </ol>

            <h3>B. By the Direction of Flow</h3>
            <ol>
            <li>Simplex Transmission: One-way communication, for example radio or television.</li><br>
            <li>Half-Duplex Transmission: Both parties can communicate but not at the same time, for example walkie-talkie.</li><br>
            <li>Full-Duplex Transmission: Both can send and receive messages at the same time, for example telephone.</li><br>
            </ol>
