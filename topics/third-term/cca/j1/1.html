        <div class="t2"><b>Definition of Drama</b></div>
        <p>
            <b>Drama </b> is a story that is acted out on stage (like in a play) or even in movies. Instead of just reading the story, you watch characters talk, move, and react to each other.

        </p>
        <div class="topic-image"><img src="../../../../images/drama.avif" alt=""></div><br>
        <div class="title" style="background-color: darkcyan;color: white;"><b>Origin of drama(How Drama Started )</b></div>
       <p>Drama originated from ancient rituals and religious festivals where performances were used to enact stories. It is believed to have developed in ancient Greece from choral performances honoring Dionysus, with Thespis being the first actor. The word "drama" itself comes from the Greek word meaning "action". </p>
       <div class="topic-image"><img src="../../../../images/origing-of-drama.jpg" alt=""></div><br>
       <ol>
        <li><b>Ancient Rituals & Storytelling </b>:   Drama first began when early humans gathered to act out stories. They used dances, chants, and masks to portray gods, heroes, or nature spirits. These performances weren't just for fun - they were sacred rituals to please gods or explain the world. Many cultures like the Egyptians and Native Americans had these dramatic ceremonies long before formal theater existed.</li><br>
        <li> <b>Greek Drama (500 BCE) </b>: The ancient Greeks turned drama into real theater with stages and scripts. They invented two main types: tragedies (serious stories about gods and heroes) and comedies (funny plays about everyday life). Famous writers like Sophocles and Aristophanes created plays that are still performed today. Theaters were huge outdoor spaces where thousands could watch the performances.</li><br>
        <li> <b>Roman Drama </b>: The Romans borrowed Greek drama but made it more spectacular. They loved exaggerated comedies with silly mistakes and physical humor. Romans built grand theaters and added exciting elements like chariot races and gladiator fights to their shows. Playwright Plautus wrote popular comedies that influenced later writers like Shakespeare.</li><br>
        <li><b>Medieval European Drama </b>: After Rome fell, drama moved into churches. Priests used simple plays to teach Bible stories to people who couldn't read. Later, traveling actors performed morality plays about good vs evil in town squares. These plays often had devils, angels, and characters representing virtues like Truth or Greed.</li><br>
        <li><b>African Traditional Drama </b>:  African drama was rich with storytelling, masks, and community participation. Griots (storytellers) acted out histories with music and dance. Ceremonies like Yoruba Egungun masquerades combined drama, religion and art. Many African plays taught moral lessons through animal characters and folk tales.</li><br>
        <li><b>Modern Drama </b> Shakespeare revolutionized drama with complex characters and beautiful language. Today, drama includes movies, TV shows, and digital content while keeping its ancient roots. Places like Broadway and Nollywood show how drama keeps evolving with new technology and global influences.</li>
       </ol><br>
       <div class="t2"><b>Why Drama Began</b></div>
       <p>
         Drama started because humans naturally love stories and pretending. It helped communities share knowledge before writing existed. From ancient rituals to modern films, drama remains powerful for teaching, entertaining, and bringing people together through shared stories.

        <div class="title" style="background-color: seagreen;color: white;"><b>Traditional Roots</b></div>
        <p>
            Long before colonization, Nigerian communities like the Yoruba, Igbo, and Hausa had rich dramatic traditions. The Yoruba Alarinjo traveling theater used masks, music, and dance to perform stories. Igbo masquerades (like Mmanwu) combined drama with spiritual ceremonies.
        </p>
