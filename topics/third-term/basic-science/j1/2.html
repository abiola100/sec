        <div class="title" style="background-color: purple;color: white;"><b>FORCE</b></div>

        <div class="t2"><b>Meaning of Force</b></div>
        
        <p>Force is a push or a pull that can change the state of motion of an object.</p>
        <p>It helps us to move objects, stop them, or change their direction.</p>
        <p>Unit of measurement: Newton (N)</p>
        <p>Example: Pushing a door, pulling a rope, or lifting a book all involve force.</p>

         <br><br>
         <div class="title" style="background-color: seagreen;color: white;"><b>Types of Forces</b></div>

        <h3>A. Contact Forces (forces acting when objects touch)</h3>
        <ol>
        <li><strong>Frictional Force:</strong> Resistance when two surfaces slide or try to slide over each other. <br>Example: Sliding a box on the floor.</li><br>
        <li><strong>Tension Force:</strong> Force transmitted through a rope, string, or wire when pulled tight. <br>Example: Pulling a rope in tug-of-war.</li><br>
        <li><strong>Applied Force:</strong> Force applied directly to move an object. <br>Example: Pushing a chair.</li><br>
        <li><strong>Normal Force:</strong> The support force exerted by a surface on an object resting on it. <br>Example: A book resting on a table.</li><br>
        </ol>

        <h3>B. Non-Contact Forces (forces acting without physical contact)</h3>
        <ol>
        <li><strong>Gravitational Force:</strong> Force of attraction between objects due to their masses. <br>Example: Earth pulls objects downward causing them to fall.</li><br>
        <li><strong>Magnetic Force:</strong> Force of attraction or repulsion between magnets or magnetic materials. <br>Example: A magnet attracting iron nails.</li><br>
        <li><strong>Electrostatic Force:</strong> Force between electrically charged objects. <br>Example: Rubbing a balloon on hair and it sticking to a wall.</li><br>
        </ol><br><br>

        <div class="title" style="background-color: darkkhaki;color: black;"><b> Effects of Force</b></div>
        <ol>
        <li>Start a stationary object moving. <br>Example: Pushing a parked car.</li><br>
        <li>Stop a moving object. <br>Example: Applying brakes to a bicycle.</li><br>
        <li>Change the direction of motion. <br>Example: Kicking a ball sideways.</li><br>
        <li>Change the shape or size of an object. <br>Example: Stretching a rubber band or squeezing clay.</li><br>
        </ol><br>

        <div class="title" style="background-color: darkolivegreen;color: white;"><b>Factors Affecting Force</b></div>
        <ol>
        <li>Magnitude of the force applied: Greater force produces a bigger effect.</li><br>
        <li>Mass of the object: Heavier objects require more force to move.</li><br>
        <li>Surface type: Rough surfaces increase friction, smooth surfaces reduce it.</li><br>
        </ol><br>

        <div class="title" style="background-color: sienna;color: white;"><b>Friction</b></div>
        <p>Friction is a force that opposes motion between two surfaces in contact.</p>
        <p>It helps in walking, stopping vehicles, holding objects, and controlling movement, but it can also cause wear and tear or energy loss.</p>

        <div class="title" style="background-color: darkkhaki;color: black;"><b>Uses of Friction</b></div>
        <ol>
        <li>Helps walking and running without slipping by providing grip between shoes and the ground.</li><br>
        <li>Allows vehicles to brake effectively by preventing skidding and maintaining control.</li><br>
        <li>Helps in gripping and holding objects, like holding a pen or carrying a bag.</li><br>
        <li>Enables machines to function properly, such as gears in engines or belts in pulleys transmitting motion.</li><br>
        <li>Assists in controlling motion, for example, slowing down a sliding object or stopping a moving car safely.</li><br>
        </ol><br>

        <div class="title" style="background-color: seagreen;color: white;"><b>Advantages of Friction</b></div>
        <ol>
        <li>Prevents slipping and sliding, making walking and driving safer.</li><br>
        <li>Enables motion control, allowing vehicles and machines to start, stop, or change direction.</li><br>
        <li>Helps machines and tools to work properly by transmitting forces where needed.</li><br>
        <li>Generates heat in some useful applications, such as in matchsticks or brakes.</li><br>
        <li>Provides resistance that allows construction activities like sanding, filing, or gripping objects effectively.</li><br>
        </ol><br>

        <div class="title" style="background-color: tan;color: black;"><b>Disadvantages of Friction</b></div>
        <ol>
        <li>Causes wear and tear of moving parts, leading to frequent maintenance of machines.</li><br>
        <li>Produces unwanted heat, wasting energy in engines or machinery.</li><br>
        <li>Slows down machines and reduces efficiency, increasing fuel or energy consumption.</li><br>
        <li>Can damage surfaces due to abrasion, like scratched floors or worn-out tires.</li><br>
        <li>Makes motion harder to start or maintain, requiring more force to move objects on rough surfaces.</li><br>
        </ol><br>

        <div class="title" style="background-color: darkcyan;color: white;"><b>Types of Friction</b></div>
        <ol>
        <li>Static Friction: Prevents motion of a stationary object. <br>Example: A stationary car resisting initial push.</li><br>
        <li>Kinetic (Sliding) Friction: Opposes motion of a moving object. <br>Example: Sliding a box.</li><br>
        <li>Rolling Friction: Resists motion of a rolling object. <br>Example: Car wheels on the road.</li><br>
        <li>Fluid Friction: Resistance when moving through air or water. <br>Example: Swimming or air resistance on a plane.</li><br>
        </ol>

       

       

        <div class="title" style="background-color: sienna;color: white;"><b>Gravity</b></div>
        <p>Gravity is a natural force that pulls objects toward the center of the Earth or any object that has mass. It is an attractive force that acts between all objects in the universe.</p>

        <p>Importance of Gravity:</p>
        <ol>
        <li>Causes objects to fall toward the ground when dropped, which helps us understand motion and safety.</li><br>
        <li>Keeps planets, moons, and satellites in their orbits around larger celestial bodies, maintaining the structure of the solar system.</li><br>
        <li>Gives weight to objects. The weight of an object is the force of gravity acting on its mass.</li><br>
        <li>Allows us to walk, run, and perform daily activities without floating off the ground.</li><br>
        <li>Plays a crucial role in natural phenomena such as tides, ocean currents, and the formation of rivers and valleys.</li><br>
        </ol>

        <p>Acceleration due to gravity (g) is the rate at which objects increase their speed when falling freely under the influence of gravity. On Earth, it is approximately <strong>10 m/s²</strong>. This means an object falling freely gains a speed of 10 meters per second every second.</p>

        <p>Formula relating weight and gravity: <br>
        Weight (W) = Mass (m) × Acceleration due to gravity (g)</p>
        <p>Unit of weight: Newton (N)</p><br>


        
        <div class="title" style="background-color: darkkhaki; color: black;"><b>Measuring Force</b></div>

        <p>Force is a push or a pull that can cause an object to move, stop, or change its shape or direction. To understand and quantify this, we measure force using instruments designed for this purpose.</p>

        <h3>Instruments to Measure Force:</h3>
        <ul>
        <li><strong>Spring Balance:</strong> A simple device that measures force by the extension or compression of a spring. The force applied stretches the spring, and the reading on the scale shows the force in Newtons (N). <br>Example: Measuring the weight of a book or a small object.</li><br>
        <li><strong>Newton Meter:</strong> A more precise instrument that measures force in Newtons, often used in physics experiments to determine the force applied on objects.</li><br>
        </ul>

        <h3>Formula for Force:</h3>
        <p>The force acting on an object can be calculated using Newton’s Second Law of Motion:</p>
        <p><strong>Force (F) = Mass (m) × Acceleration (a)</strong></p>

        <ul>
        <li><strong>Mass (m):</strong> The amount of matter in the object (measured in kilograms, kg).</li><br>
        <li><strong>Acceleration (a):</strong> The rate at which the object’s velocity changes (measured in meters per second squared, m/s²).</li><br>
        </ul>

        <h3>Unit of Force:</h3>
        <p>The standard unit of force is the <strong>Newton (N)</strong>. One Newton is the force required to accelerate a mass of 1 kilogram at a rate of 1 meter per second squared.</p>

        <h3>Example:</h3>
        <p>If a mass of 2 kg is accelerating at 3 m/s², the force applied is:</p>
        <p>F = m × a = 2 × 3 = 6 N</p>
        <p>This means a force of 6 Newtons is acting on the object.</p><br>


        <div class="title" style="background-color: seagreen; color: white;"><b>Balanced and Unbalanced Forces</b></div>

        <p>Forces acting on objects can either be balanced or unbalanced, which affects how objects move.</p>

        <ul>
        <li><strong>Balanced Forces:</strong> These are forces that are equal in size but act in opposite directions. They cancel each other out, so the object does not change its motion. <br>
        <strong>Example:</strong> A book resting on a table remains at rest because the downward gravitational force is exactly balanced by the upward normal force from the table.</li><br>

        <li><strong>Unbalanced Forces:</strong> These occur when the forces acting on an object are not equal or opposite. They result in a change in the object's motion, such as starting, stopping, or changing direction. <br>
        <strong>Example:</strong> Pushing a stationary box so it begins to move, because the applied force is greater than the friction resisting motion.</li><br>
        </ul>

        <h3>Setting Up Experiments to Demonstrate Forces</h3>

        <ul>
        <li><strong>Balanced Force Experiment:</strong> Attach identical weights to both ends of a horizontally placed spring balance. Observe that the spring balance does not move because the forces are equal and opposite. This shows that balanced forces do not change motion.</li><br>

        <li><strong>Unbalanced Force Experiment:</strong> Use a spring balance with unequal weights or push a toy car on a flat surface. Observe that the car moves in the direction of the larger force. This demonstrates that unbalanced forces cause a change in motion.</li><br>
        </ul><br><br>

        <div class="title" style="background-color: sienna;color: white;"><b> Pressure and Force</b></div>

        <p>Pressure is the amount of force applied per unit area on a surface. It helps us understand how force is distributed over a given area and why some objects penetrate surfaces more easily than others.</p>

        <h3>Formula:</h3>
        <p><strong>Pressure (P) = Force (F) ÷ Area (A)</strong></p>

        <ul>
        <li><strong>Force (F):</strong> The push or pull applied to an object (measured in Newtons, N).</li><br>
        <li><strong>Area (A):</strong> The surface area over which the force is applied (measured in square meters, m²).</li><br>
        </ul>

        <h3>Unit:</h3>
        <p>The standard unit of pressure is the <strong>Pascal (Pa)</strong>, where 1 Pa = 1 N/m².</p>

        <h3>Examples in Daily Life:</h3>
        <ol>
        <li>A sharp knife cuts easily because the same force is applied over a very small area, creating high pressure.</li><br>
        <li>A person lying on a bed of nails does not get hurt because the weight is spread over many nails, reducing the pressure on each point.</li><br>
        <li>Car tires have a larger surface area in contact with the ground than a narrow pencil, so the pressure is lower, preventing the tires from sinking into soft ground.</li><br>
        <li>Snowshoes increase the area of contact with snow, reducing pressure and preventing a person from sinking.</li><br>
        <li>High-pressure water jets are used to cut metals because concentrated force over a small area produces enough pressure to cut through the material.</li><br>
        </ol><br>
        <div class="title" style="background-color: darkkhaki;color: black;"><b>Importance of Pressure</b></div>

        
        <ol>
        <li>It Helps us to understand why sharp tools cut easily while blunt tools do not.</li><br>
        <li>It is Important in designing vehicles, shoes, and building structures to prevent sinking or damage.</li><br>
        <li>It is Essential in hydraulic systems, where pressure is used to lift heavy objects with small applied force.</li><br>
        <li>It Helps in understanding natural phenomena like weather systems (air pressure) and ocean currents.</li><br>
        <li>It is Useful in medicine, for example in syringes where force applied on a small area pushes liquid out efficiently.</li><br>
        </ol>
