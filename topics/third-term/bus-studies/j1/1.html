        <div class="t2"><b>Meaning of Book-keeping</b></div>
        <p><b>Book-keeping</b> is the process of recording all business transactions in a systematic and orderly manner so that the financial position of a business can be known at any time.</p>

        <p>Every business, whether small or large, buys and sells goods, receives and spends money, and has to keep accurate records of these transactions. Book-keeping ensures that every transaction is written down correctly, using the right figures and dates, in the right books.</p>

        <p>In simple terms: Book-keeping means keeping the record of money received and money spent by a business.</p>

        <p>It is the foundation of accounting. Without proper book-keeping, it would be impossible to know whether a business is making profit or loss.</p>
