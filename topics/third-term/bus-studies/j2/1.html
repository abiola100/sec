        <br><br>

        <br><br>
        <div class="title" style="background-color: darkcyan;color: white;"><b>Common Practices in Book Keeping</b></div>
        
        <p>Every business that keeps records must follow some common <strong>book keeping</strong> practices to make sure the records are correct and complete. These practices include:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Recording every transaction as soon as it happens.</li><br>
            <li>Using source documents such as <strong>receipts</strong>, <strong>invoices</strong>, and <strong>vouchers</strong> as evidence for every transaction.</li><br>
            <li>Classifying transactions into the right accounts (for example, assets, liabilities, expenses, and income).</li><br>
            <li>Posting entries into books of original entry (journals) and then to the <strong>ledger</strong>.</li><br>
            <li>Balancing the accounts at regular intervals.</li><br>
            <li>Preparing trial balance, profit and loss account, and balance sheet when necessary.</li><br>
            <li>Ensuring <strong>transparency</strong>, <strong>accountability</strong>, and honesty in all financial records.</li><br>
        </ol>
        <p>These practices make <strong>book keeping</strong> complete and dependable, which in turn brings success to the business.</p>

        <br><br>
        <div class="title" style="background-color: tan;color: black;"><b>Book Keeping Documents</b></div>
        
        <p>A <strong>book keeper</strong> uses certain documents to record transactions. These are called <strong>source documents</strong>.</p>
        <p>Some important <strong>book keeping</strong> documents are:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Receipts</strong> – Proof that money has been received.</li><br>
            <li><strong>Invoices</strong> – Requests for payment for goods or services supplied.</li><br>
            <li><strong>Vouchers</strong> – Internal documents that authorize payments.</li><br>
            <li><strong>Payment slips</strong> – Evidence of payments made through banks.</li><br>
            <li><strong>Bank statements</strong> – Records from the bank showing transactions in the business account.</li><br>
        </ol>
        <p>These documents serve as evidence of business activities and are the basis for entries in the books of account.</p>

        <br><br>
        <div class="title" style="background-color: sienna;color: white;"><b>The Double Entry System</b></div>
        
        <p><strong>Book keeping</strong> uses the <strong>double entry system</strong>. This means that every transaction has two sides: something is given and something is received.</p>

        <h3><strong>(a) Meaning</strong></h3>
        <p><strong>Double entry book keeping</strong> is a system where every transaction affects at least two accounts — one is debited and the other is credited with the same amount.</p>

        <h3><strong>(b) Principle</strong></h3>
        <p>The principle of <strong>double entry</strong> states that for every debit entry, there must be a corresponding credit entry.</p>

        <h3><strong>(c) Example</strong></h3>
        <p>When a business buys furniture for cash:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Furniture Account</strong> is debited (because the business has received furniture).</li><br>
            <li><strong>Cash Account</strong> is credited (because cash has been given out).</li><br>
        </ol>
        <p>When goods are sold on credit:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Debtor’s Account</strong> is debited (because the customer now owes the business).</li><br>
            <li><strong>Sales Account</strong> is credited (because goods have been sold).</li><br>
        </ol>

        <h3><strong>(d) The Books Used</strong></h3>
        <p><strong>Journal</strong>: This is the book of original entry where all transactions are first recorded in date order.</p>
        <p><strong>Ledger</strong>: This is the book of secondary entry where transactions from the journal are posted into individual accounts to show their balances.</p>

        <h3><strong>(e) Classification of Accounts</strong></h3>
        <p>There are three main types of accounts:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Real Accounts</strong> – relate to physical assets such as building, land, furniture.</li><br>
            <li><strong>Personal Accounts</strong> – relate to persons or organizations such as debtors and creditors.</li><br>
            <li><strong>Nominal Accounts</strong> – relate to expenses, income, losses, and gains such as rent, wages, and commission.</li><br>
        </ol><br>
        <div class="title" style="background-color: darkolivegreen;color: white;"><b>Ethics in Book Keeping</b></div>

        
        <p>Ethics are the moral principles that guide the behaviour of people in business. In <strong>book keeping</strong>, ethics means being honest and fair when keeping records.</p>
        <p>Three important ethical principles are known as <strong>TAP</strong>:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Transparency</strong> – Being open and clear in all financial dealings.</li><br>
            <li><strong>Accountability</strong> – Being ready to explain and justify financial records and actions.</li><br>
            <li><strong>Probity</strong> – Having strong moral principles such as honesty and uprightness.</li><br>
        </ol>
        <p>Ethical <strong>book keeping</strong> helps to prevent corruption and ensures that all business transactions are fair and truthful.</p>

        <br><br>
        <div class="title" style="background-color: darkkhaki;color: black;"><b> How Book keeping  Leads to Business Success</b></div>
        
        <p><strong>Book keeping</strong> is very important for the success of any business because it helps in many ways:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Helps you to</strong> make decisions – The owner can use financial records to plan for the future.</li><br>
            <li>Improves control – It helps to monitor income and expenses and prevent waste or theft.</li><br>
